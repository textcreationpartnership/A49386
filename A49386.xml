         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Will not increaſe the Bulk or Price of this Book, by giving the World an account of all the Reaſons that mov'd me to publiſh it; let it ſuffice to tell you, that 'tis a Deſign of great Charity for your Temporal and Eternal Intereſt. I would, as much as lies in me, render your Eſtate eaſie, profitable, and at leaſt not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable, which I ſhall certainly effect, if I can perſuade you to Contentment, and a faithful
<pb facs="tcp:96201:3"/>
diſcharge of your Duty in your Place; for 'tis not the Nature of Service, but the Faults of Servants, which render this ſtate uneaſie and contemptible, the greateſt Burthen and Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of it being in truth to be imputed to the unreaſonable Diſcontents, to the negligent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, or undiſcreet behaviour of many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. I would poſſeſs you therefore with ſuch Virtues as may render you the Favourites and Confidents of your Maſters, dear to them (as you ought to be) next to their own Children; and by being ſo, you will become more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to all that know you, and nearer every day to Advancement: Theſe Virtues are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in your Condition, Juſtice, Truth, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, Humility, the Fear of God, and ſuch like. By the Practice of theſe, you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World, that you differ from the Rich and Great only in outward Circumſtances, that you have true Honour and Goodneſs in your Souls, and that you have nothing mean in you beſides your Fortune: Theſe therefore
<pb facs="tcp:96201:3"/>
cannot miſs of making you worthy to be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be beloved, to be truſted, to be encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged.</p>
            <p>But this is not the utmoſt of my Deſign, I would make you Happy and Glorious hereafter, I would make you the Children, the Heirs of God, and Joynt-Heirs with Chriſt, though the Servants of Men; I would deliver you from the Bondage of Sin and Satan, and make you partakers of the true Liberty of the Sons of God. Now this cannot be done, unleſs you can be prevail'd with to love and purſue after thoſe Virtues which become your condition in the World, and ſo diſcharge your Duties conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly; for I muſt deal faithfully with you, no man can be a good Chriſtian, who is not good in that ſtation wherein God has placed him: You cannot then be Obedient Servants of God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you be Faithful Servants of Men; nor yet do I confine the whole of your Duty within the compaſs of your <hi>Service</hi> to Man, there is a Duty alſo which you owe to God, which you are
<pb facs="tcp:96201:4"/>
to perform in the firſt place, not only becauſe he is your Chief and Beſt Maſter, (I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have ſaid, your Good Lord and Father too) but alſo, becauſe this is the beſt and moſt ſolid Foundation of your Duty towards Man; and therefore eaſily conceiving that no good, nay no wiſe Man will grudge you the time that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the Service of God, ſince unleſs this be perform'd, they can neither expect that you ſhould ſerve them as you ought, nor if they did, that God would give a Bleſsing to your Service. I have taken care to direct you alſo in this little Treatiſe, how to imploy this time, laying down ſuch Rules as may be more peculiarly uſeful to you in Reading, Hearing the Word, Receiving the Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Method I have followed is very plain, and I need give you no other account of it, than what you have in the Title. <hi>I</hi> have nothing more but to beſeech you, that you would joyn with me in hearty Prayers to God, that he would bleſs this my Endeavour with ſucceſs, not only to
<pb facs="tcp:96201:4"/>
your Advantage and Comfort, but to the Peace and Intereſt of all Families, which is nearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in your Behaviour, that he would poſſeſs all of you with Virtues ſuitable to your Quality and Condition in the World, with a Spirit of Meekneſs and Humility, with a Spirit of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and Induſtry, with a Spirit of Love and Gratitude, and with a Spirit of Fear of, and Dependence upon him our God, that ſo you may not only be conſiderable and uſeful in your Places, but alſo Examples of an Excellent Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and by a neceſſary conſequence happy here, and glorious hereafter, which is the ſincere Deſire of</p>

nay, what is more, members of the ſame body, for you have one Head Chriſt Jeſus; and therefore ſuch will treat you with Charity and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and will as heartily ſeek your Intereſt as their own; for 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but that a good man ſhould <hi>make much of them that fear the Lord.</hi> But beſides that gain which you will reap from the Countenance and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, or receive from the hand of a Religious Maſter, there are two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Advantages which the Religion of any Family gives the Servants of it, <hi>Credit and Reputation in the World,</hi> and the <hi>Bleſsing of God,</hi> which how much they conduce to your Worldly Intereſt, I need not, I ſuppoſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you.</p>
               <p>But, ſuppoſe this Choice of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Family did not ſerve your Worldly Intereſt altogether ſo well as the Choice of ſome other perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture might, yet ſurely it beſt ſerves your Eternal Intereſt; and therefore a Religious Family is to be preferr'd, eſpecially by people of greener years. 'Tis true, a good man,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96201:18"/>
like <hi>Joſeph,</hi> may ſerve the God of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> in the Houſe of <hi>Potiphar;</hi> but ſure, nothing but Neceſſity, not his own Choice, ſhall bring him thither; the Salvation of the Soul is the<note n="*" place="margin">Luke 10.42.</note> 
                  <hi>one thing needful,</hi> and therefore this is the Intereſt that is firſt to be ſecur'd. They have certainly but little Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for Religion, who will prefer the gain of two or three Crowns in a year, with the hazard of their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, before all the Advantages of a Religious and well-govern'd Family. They are certainly very little ſenſible of the danger of Temptations, and the weakneſs of Human Nature, who for a very inconſiderable profit are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to expoſe themſelves to the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ill Company, to the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ill Example, which are much more apt to affect you, when Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Intereſt is joyned with the Deceitfulneſs of ſin, as in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Maſters and others whom you depend upon and reſpect. 'Tis an unſpeakable diſadvantage to your Virtue and Religion, to be in a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where you muſt wholly want the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96201:18"/>
common means of Grace, I mean the Reading of the Word of God, good Inſtruction, Prayer, and a Chriſtian Diſcipline in the Family: But how much greater diſadvantage when theſe are not only neglected, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd and derided? To live bereav'd of the Means of Grace in a mere Dearth of Spiritual Food, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy ſtate; but to live amidſt daily Temptations, and even Solicitations to ſin, is an unhappier ſtill. If young unexperienced people are apt to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get God, even in thoſe Families where they are often put in mind of him, how will they remember him where all forget him? If they can hardly be preſerv'd by the Care of a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maſter, and the conſcientious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of Religious Duties, how will they be ſecur'd in a Family where there are no opportunities or means of Virtue? and not only ſo, but where there are all opportunities and means of Vice, and where Vice is countenanced and encourag'd by common practice?</p>

                  <hi>thing is needful,</hi> ſaid our Saviour to <hi>Martha,</hi> when <hi>ſhe was cumbred about much ſerving,</hi> when <hi>ſhe was careful and troubled about many things,</hi> and that is Religion. Religion is as neceſſary for a Servant as a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, for a Peaſant as a Prince; for Salvation is of equal importance to both, and I cannot ſee, but that thoſe of the meaneſt Rank lie under as ſtrong Obligations to Religion as any other men do. If the Condition
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:96201:21"/>
of a Servant be well weigh'd,<note place="margin">A Servant is leſs liable to Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions than others.</note> it will be found, that he has fewer Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to, and conſequently excuſes for ſin, than any other ſort of men; for he is reſtrain'd and kept within the bounds of a Regular &amp; Civil Life by the neceſſities of his Fortune, by the confinement of his Duty, and by the indiſpenſible Attendance of his Place: Ambition, Idleneſs and Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which are the great Incentives to ſin and folly in other men, are not ordinarily incident to the ſtate of <hi>Servants:</hi> Beſides, that Labour and Care is a ſort of good Diſcipline to the body, and keeps it more modeſt and humble in its Appetite. 'Tis true, there are a ſort of <hi>Servants</hi> which ſerve rather for grandeur, than any neceſſary Duty, who are only the ſtate of the Hall and Antichamber, and the Ornament of Coaches; ſuch are generally too well fed, and too little imploy'd, and conſequently, they are expos'd in a ſtate of Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude almoſt to all the Temptations, that men of the higheſt Rank are; it were heartily to be wiſht, that ſuch
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96201:21"/>
as theſe would reſcue themſelves from this worſt ſort of Servitude, by betaking themſelves to ſomething that might conſiſt with their Service; and it highly concerns the Maſters of ſuch, as they would avoid the guilt of their <hi>Servants</hi> Ruin, to find out ſome ways to employ them; in the mean time, they are to ſtand like Souldiers on their Guard, and while they keep with Sobriety and ſtrict Attendance to their <hi>Pòſt,</hi> I hope they may be ſaid to be upon their Duty, and in their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and may be ſo accounted by God. But to paſs on from the Conſideration of this Caſe, which is not altogether ſo common, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Ordinary ſort of <hi>Servants,</hi> beſides the Reſtraints which <hi>Servants</hi> lie under, which are ſo many Guards and Fences of Virtue, beſides the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail and hardſhip which the Body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoes, which is a ſort of Diſcipline to it, they are reſtrained from ſin by the narrowneſs of their Fortune, which ſhould reaſonably, nay muſt neceſſarily keep 'em from expenſive ſin, (and almoſt all ſins are ſuch,) and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:96201:22"/>
by Hopes and Fears more peculiar to this ſtate than any other they dread, or at leaſt ſhould do ſo, not only the diſpleaſure of God, but of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters too: Their good Fortune de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends directly and immediately on their good Behaviour, and 'tis next to an impoſſibility, that they ſhould fall into Vicious Courſes, but that they muſt at the ſame time fall into Ruine as well Temporal as Eternal, being diſcarded, diſgrac'd, and not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfully thruſt out of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>Service,</hi> but thereby made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of another. To all theſe Conſiderations, I might peradventure add one more, that ſin in it ſelf is not ſo taking or luſcious to a <hi>Servant,</hi> as to thoſe of higher quality: The World doth not court them in ſo much Pomp and Luſtre, as it doth the Rich and the Great: Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not ſet off with ſo many Beauties and Ornaments, when dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and prepar'd for the <hi>Servant,</hi> as when for the Maſter; and as this Rank of People doth not encounter the ſame force and allurement in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:96201:22"/>
Temptations; ſo they have more Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, Fears and Checks mixt with their ſinful Enjoyments, than others have; ſo that upon the whole, I may conclude, that the <hi>Servant</hi> who lives in any Courſe of Vice, is of all Sots the moſt deſperate; he breaks through more reſtraints to commit ſin; he runs more hazards to be damned than any other man whatever; he ſets his Soul at a viler Rate than any other Mortal, and rather than not be ruin'd and be damn'd; he will be <hi>both</hi> without Temptation, and without Pleaſure: Ah infatuated wretch! that will be miſerable in deſpight of God and Fortune too! that will be vicious and wretched in deſpight of ſo many difficulties and diſcouragements, and are content to be ruin'd rather than not be damn'd! A man would think Damnation had Temptation in it, for the poor deſpicable ſins, by which theſe wretched creatures incur it, have none.</p>
               <p>That ſtation is very commodious for Virtue,<note place="margin">A Servant enjoys ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny peculiar Motives to Religion.</note> which has in it no Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to Vice: But beſides this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:96201:23"/>
                  <hi>Service</hi> contains in it ſome Incitements to Holineſs, almoſt pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to this ſtate. A mean Fortune, like Calamities, whets and ſharpens thoſe Minds that have any ſparks of honour or courage in 'em; he may be thought juſtly to deſerve a mean Fortune, and a ſervile Condition, who does not labour to qualifie himſelf for a better. Virtue then is wholly neceſſary to redeem mean perſons from Servitude and Contempt, and therefore, if a <hi>Servant</hi> had any Soul, it ſhould, methinks, be enkindled with an honeſt Ambition of coming up, though not to the Fortune, yet to the Merit of thoſe above him; he ſhould be zealous to compenſate the meanneſs of his Birth and Condition, by the Virtue of his Life, and the goodneſs of his Actions: This is that which will ſet him on the ſame level with the Rich and Mighty, if any thing will; for whatever looſe and vain people may talk, great Virtues are excellent Qualifications, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Men extremely ſerviceable and neceſſary in the World. 'Tis very
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:96201:23"/>
rare that any man does long want a higher ſtation, who has Ability enough to fill it; however it be, he is as truly great who truly meriteth Greatneſs, as he that poſſeſſeth it. Beſides this, that Virtue is the moſt natural way to advance a mean man's Fortune; there is in this ſtate one further Motive to Virtue, which is, that a <hi>Servant</hi> ſtands almoſt in daily need of it: So many and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous are the Pleaſures of the Wealthy and the Great, that while theſe laſt, as they deſire not to exchange their Paradiſe for a Heaven; ſo they do not diſcern the Uſe and Neceſſity of thoſe Virtues that qualifie 'em for it; they do not feel the want of Spiritual and Inward Pleaſures, who are wholly taken up with Carnal ones; they need not the ſupport of Faith, or the Belief of another World, who are more than well enough content with this; they ſee not the Uſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God, who have goods laid up for many years, and are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in their hearts, as if their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were ſuch that they could defie
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:96201:24"/>
the common Events of Providence to reduce 'em to Neceſſity. What buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs have they for Patience, Induſtry, Moderation, where every thing not only obeys their <hi>Will,</hi> but flatters their Fancy, and their Wealth is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſupport Idleneſs and Riot too? But in the condition of Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, all is the quite contrary, they cannot only not live happily in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, but they cannot live pleaſantly in this without Virtue; the Peace and pleaſure of their Minds is neceſſary to compenſate the Travail of their Bodies, the belief of another Life to render this tolerable and eaſy: Patience, Meekneſs, Induſtry is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary in <hi>them,</hi> to render them contented and ſatisfied in their ſtation: The Reaſon's plain, without theſe they cannot be good <hi>Servants,</hi> and every Service is a burden, and ſlavery to an ill one: So that Virtue is as needful to the Happineſs of a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> as his Food or his Wages; his ſtate is ſlaviſh &amp; unſupportable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, free and eaſie with it. I will take upon my ſelf the perſon of a <hi>Servant,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:96201:24"/>
that I may the better expreſs the force and ſtrength of theſe Arguments which I have made uſe of to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade <hi>Servants</hi> to become Religious. I ſee my Condition, my Parents are unable to ſerve me, I have no Friends, none that can, or none that will be of any conſiderable uſe to me. What ſhall I do? I have but one way to render my ſelf dear to God, or valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Man, and that is by living re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly and virtuouſly; if I do otherwiſe, God will caſt me off, I ſhall meet with Contempt from Man, and what is worſe, I ſhall deſerve it; I ſhall ever be a ſlave, and ever deſerve to be ſo: Pity and compaſſion is the higheſt honour and favour from Man that I muſt ever aſpire to, and when my ſtrength for drudgery fails, <hi>that,</hi> it may be, will do ſo too; and then Beggery and Reproach muſt be the Portion of my decay'd Age. I can never think on theſe things, but I am filled with bluſhes and diſdain; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I have a Rational and Immortal Soul as well as the Rich and Wealthy: and ſure the Incenſe of Virtuous
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:96201:25"/>
Actions, and devout Prayers, would ſmell as ſweet to God, if offer'd up by me, as by a more Fortunate Man; and if ſo, what Reaſon have I to diſtruſt, but that God who is rich in bounty towards <hi>all,</hi> would be ſo towards me too? Well then, I am ſtedfaſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, that I will lead an unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life, and whatever my Fortune be, the World ſhall ſee I can deſerve a good one; and by this, if I do not thrive and proſper, and get in time into a better ſtation, I ſhall obtain this unſpeakable Advantage, that I ſhall render my preſent one both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and eaſie: 'Tis not a ſervile Birth, nor ſervile Fortune, but a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Mind that makes a Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, a Mind that has no Faith, no Truth, no Courage, no Induſtry, no Gratitude, that is, in one word, no Honour in it: But if I have all theſe, and if together with all this, Moderation, ſo that I am my own Maſter, though another's <hi>Servant,</hi> I am in ſuch caſe full of Honour, no Cloud of Meanneſs can obſcure or conceal me, I am a Star viſible by my
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:96201:25"/>
own Light, a Gem valuable for my own intrinſick worth, I ſhall be beloved and reſpected wherever I am; for Virtue, how ever it be clad, has beauty and majeſty on its forehead; nor is this all, my ſtation will be full of eaſe as well as credit, for what ſhould trouble me? The Travail and Care of my Place? Alas! this is but pleaſure to the induſtrious! the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of thoſe I depend upon? Alas! I ſhall never fall under it, or at leaſt, I ſhall never deſerve it! and then the peace and the ſatisfaction of my mind will more delight me than ever their weakneſs can diſturb me! Finally, what can it be that can trouble me? The uncertainty of a <hi>Servants</hi> ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? why, while I live virtuouſly, I can never want; whatever betides me, I have a God, an Almighty God that cares for me, and if the worſt comes to the worſt, my trouble can be but ſhort, my <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>it</hi> will end at leaſt together, and then Glory and Eternity will receive me.</p>
               <p>Thus I hope I have convinced Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the many Obligations they
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:96201:26"/>
lie under to be Religious: I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted a little largely upon this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ever found it a harder Task to perſuade people to do their Duty, than to teach 'em what it is. But againſt all that has been ſaid, two things are wont to be objected; <hi>Firſt,</hi> The meanneſs of their Capacity, or at leaſt Education: And <hi>ſecondly,</hi> their want of time or opportunity for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Duties;<note place="margin">Objection of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's Inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd.</note> but both theſe are mere ſhifts and pretences; for as to the <hi>firſt,</hi> their Souls are endow'd with the ſame Faculties and Capacities, they have the ſame Reaſon, Courage and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality with the Rich or Mighty, as 'tis evident from innumerable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of men, who, aſcending from the loweſt to the higheſt ſtation, have not only filled, but adorn'd it too. As to Education, here I confeſs, there is ſome difference between thoſe of a higher and lower Rank, but as 'tis generally manag'd, it conſiſts in ſuch poor punctilio's, ſuch trifling and ſlight Accompliſhments, that 'tis not eaſie to ſay on which ſide the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage lies: But omitting this, I will
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:96201:26"/>
put you in mind of one thing that will ſilence all excuſes of this ſort. The Philoſophy of Chriſtianity, which is the only true Wiſdom, doth not require a learned Education; a poor Fiſher-man now, as well as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, is as capable and fit for it, as he that is bred up at the feet of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliel:</hi> The Belief of another Life depends not on niceties and ſubtilties of arguing, but on the Reſurrection of <hi>Jeſus</hi> from the dead; not the acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Philoſopher, but the beſt liver has the fulleſt Convictions, and the moſt lively and tranſporting Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of Divine Truths.<note n="*" place="margin">John 7.17.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man will do his will, he ſhall know of my Doctrine whether it be of God.</hi> One thing further I am to put you in mind of, that the Book of God is the great Rule and Standard of Diſcretion as well as Duty, and that Religion natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally tends to make men wiſe as well as good: There is no action of life ſo indifferent, but it has in ſome part or other of it, a Connexion with, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on our Duty, ſome degree or other of Service or Diſ ſervice to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96201:27"/>
our great End; ſo that true Rules of Policy are no where more ſucceſsfully to be ſought, than in that Book which contains all the wiſe Rules of every Imaginable Duty. If theſe things be rightly conſider'd, there is no man can ever juſtly think himſelf excus'd for his Folly or Irreligion by the meanneſs of his Birth, his Fortune, or his Education; there is not one Chriſtian Servant, but may prove an <hi>Epictetus,</hi> or ſomething much greater,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.9.</note>

there are few Servants who ſpend not ſome portion of their days and nights in theſe laſt) can lend you time for Reading and Devotion: He can never want time, who wants not Zeal for the Service of God: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, I muſt tell you, the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of all Chriſtians in general, if it be perfect, conſiſts more in practice than ſpeculation; and yours no leſs in the faithful diſcharge of the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your place, than in acts of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion towards God; but I know how apt weak people are to run from one extream to another, and therefore I will not inſiſt longer on this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leſt I ſhould be thought to place the Religion of a <hi>Servant</hi> mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſolely in the Duties of his <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</hi> There are many ways by which Servants may redeem time, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate it to the Intereſt of their Souls, and the Honour of God, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by exalting their minds to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in frequent Ejaculations, by Pious and Religious Diſcourſes to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by eaſing and aſſiſting one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which will make the burden of

The Book of God is a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy of that value, containing not only the Wiſdom of God, but the raviſhing expreſſions of his Love too, and in a word, the only way to Life and Immortality, that no one can be guilty of the neglect of it, but at the ſame time, he muſt be guilty of the moſt ingrateful Contempt of God, and the moſt ſottiſh Contempt of his own true Intereſt.

the Book which the <hi>Servant</hi> muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be familiarly acquainted with; with ſome portion of this he ſhould begin the Morning, and cloſe the Evening. Hence is that Wiſdom to be learnt, of whoſe manifold uſe<note n="*" place="margin">Prov. 6.22.</note>

                  <p>The Servants Duty, as it reſpects their Obligation to, and Preparation for the Sacrament, ſhall be handled at large in the cloſe of this Book.</p>
                  <p>I have inſiſted thus long upon theſe Duties, becauſe whoever conſcienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:96201:37"/>
performs theſe, will not be like to miſcarry in any other; I will now ſingle out thoſe other Duties which do ſeem to me more peculiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to concern Servants; for as there are ſome times, ſo there are ſome ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which do more particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the practice of ſome Virtues, as Adverſity of Patience, Proſperity of Thankfulneſs. The ſtation of a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate requires the practice of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the ſtation of a Subject the practice of Loyalty; and both the one and the other is bound to this out of Conſcience towards God: So is it in the ſtation of a Servant, tho' he muſt not look upon himſelf as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens'd from any Duty common to him with others, yet there are ſome wherein he muſt endeavour to excel and be eminent, as being more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and directly neceſſary in his Imployment; ſuch are theſe three, Fidelity to his Maſter, dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God,<note place="margin">The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to his Maſter a Duty owing to God.</note> and Contentment in his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Fidelity to his Maſter; I place this firſt, becauſe all his Prayers and Sacrifices without this, cannot be
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:96201:37"/>
accepted by God; his diligence in reading and hearing the Word is, without this, Hypocriſie; and his communicating of the Sacrament is, without this, but a bold and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous prophanation of it: And I place this here as a Duty towards God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I would have every Servant know that it really is ſo; nothing can be plainer than that the<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 6.5, &amp;c.</note> Apoſtle thought ſo, which you will readily acknowledge, if you'l read with impartiality, that weighty and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Exhortation which he makes to Servants, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.5, &amp;c. <hi>Servants, be obedient to them that are your Maſters according to the fleſh, in fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, with ſingleneſs of your heart, as unto Chriſt; not with eye-ſervice, as men-pleaſers, but as the Servants of Chriſt, doing the Will of God from the heart; with good will, doing ſervice as to the Lord, and not to men; knowing that whatſoever good thing any man doth, the ſame ſhall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</hi> How could the Apoſtle more fully or more pathetically expreſs your Obedience
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:96201:38"/>
to your Maſters to be a duty to God? he tells you, that the diſcharge of your Place is a good work, that God owns it, and will reward it as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice done to him; that it doth very much concern the Honour of your Chriſtian Profeſſion, that the Rule by which you are to behave your ſelves, is the Conſcience of its being a Duty towards God, a firm perſuaſion, that you are to be accountable for it to Chriſt our Lord and Maſter, and our Judge; and for theſe Reaſons, you are to perform this Duty with fear and trembling, that is, not an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of what you ſhall ſuffer in your Temporal Intereſt, if you perform it not faithfully, but a dread of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring Chriſt, and provoking God by it. Thoſe other Properties of the right performance of this Duty, ſingleneſs of heart, chearfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as they reſpect your Duty towards your Maſter, ſhall be treated in their proper place. I am only here to mind you, that they are here preſſed upon you as Duties to God; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle intimating, that where the

Maſter's Eye could not, there God's Eye would ſee, regard and mark the behaviour of the Servant; and that though his heart were not open to the inſpection of his Maſter, yet 'tis to God's; and therefore he muſt ſerve his Maſter from his heart too: He that is acted by ſuch a Conſcience as this, will certainly do his Duty; for when he ſhall think that God overlooks him, and fills every place which his Maſter cannot, he cannot then eaſily be tempted to allow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in murmuring, or unfaithfulneſs, or idleneſs: Whatever he would not do or ſay, if his Maſter's Eye were upon him, that being govern'd by this Conſcience, he will not do, how far ſoever he be abſent; for he will fear Damnation more than the loſs of his Service, and the diſpleaſure of God more than that of Man.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Duty towards God, which I would recommend to <hi>Servants,</hi> is,<note place="margin">2. Truſt in God.</note> 
                     <hi>Truſt in him,</hi> or <hi>dependance upon him.</hi> There is no ſtate ſo ſecure or ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, as not to ſtand in need of God, and conſequently none where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:96201:39"/>
this is not a proper Duty: But yet, it ſeems moſt proper and indiſpenſible for ſuch as have feweſt Friends, feweſt ſupports to relie upon, and ſuch are Servants; they are therefore to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be eminent in this Grace; there is no way, by which they can more directly and immediately own God, by which they can make a more publick and eminent Profeſſion of their firm Belief of his Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs. The Servant therefore muſt learn to look upon God as his Father, as his Patron, as his Guardian, as all in all to him; to <hi>him</hi> he muſt reſort for Counſel, to him he muſt complain if wrong'd, of him he muſt beg aſſiſtance, and on him alone he muſt relie for a bleſſing in all he doth, and for Proviſion: He muſt learn to call upon him in all his Straits, and praiſe him in all his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments. From the conſcientious practice of this Duty, the Maſter will reap two great Advantages; the <hi>firſt,</hi> that his Servant will do his Duty with much better courage, as aiming in all he doth, to recommend himſelf
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:96201:39"/>
not only to his Maſter, whoſe power to requite him is, it may be very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but moſt eſpecially to God, who, he knows, is a Patron that never wants either power or will to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence thoſe that apply themſelves to him: The <hi>ſecond,</hi> that God will bleſs him and all he has for his Servants ſake: This was the Advantage which <hi>Potiphar</hi> enjoy'd in the Service of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> and <hi>Laban,</hi> in that of <hi>Jacob;</hi> the Proſperity of thoſe Idolaters being owing to the Religion of their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; the Servant, beſides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and ſatisfaction of his mind ariſing from his frequent Addreſſes to God; and beſides the actual bleſſings which God will one time or other certainly beſtow upon thoſe that truſt in him, will alſo find a good ſupport, a ready Antidote againſt all the real and imaginary Evils of his ſtate: For, were but this Duty of <hi>Truſt in God</hi> conſcientiouſly practiſed, Servants of ability and ſpirit would never want encouragement, nor thoſe of meaner Capacity ſatisfaction and comfort: They who ſerv'd in hope, would be
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:96201:40"/>
able in deſpight of an ill face and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of their preſent Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to carry their proſpect farther, and believe their Advancement very eaſie to God, though it ſcarce appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed probable to the Eye of Man; and they whoſe Ambition mounts no higher than a mean Service, would not be frightned by fears of want in Sickneſs or in Age, as being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that God cares for them. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſaid this, I cannot think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſtir you up to truſt in God by any new Motives; for the two which I have inſinuated are, methinks, abundantly ſufficient, namely, <hi>firſt,</hi> the pleaſure and ſatisfaction of mind that ſprings from it, in that it gives men an unſhaken ſupport and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a troubleſom and uncertain World; hence that of the<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 4.8.</note> Pſalmiſt, <hi>I will both lay me down in peace and ſleep, for thou only makeſt me dwell in ſafety.</hi> And hence 'tis, that a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Security, even amongſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces and Allarms of approaching Dangers, is by the Pſalmiſt made the Character of one that truſts in God,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:96201:40"/>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 112.17.</note> 
                     <hi>He will not be afraid of any evil ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, his heart is fixed truſting in the Lord.</hi> A <hi>ſecond</hi> Motive is the actual Benefit this Truſt procures you, namely, Relief in all your Wants, and Deliverance in all your Dangers; for this is that the Scripture teaches us;<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 34.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Fear the Lord ye his Saints; for there is no want to them that fear him: The young Lions do lack and ſuffer hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but they that ſeek the Lord ſhall not want any good thing.</hi> And ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.1. <hi>God is our Refuge and Strength; a very preſent help in trouble.</hi> O that you would be perſuaded to make a Trial of the Pleaſure and Happineſs of this Duty, that you would expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the bleſſedneſs of that ſtate, wherein a man hath nothing to do, but<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 4.5.</note> to <hi>ſacrifize the Sacrifice of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and put his Truſt in the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>third</hi> great Duty of the Servant towards God,<note place="margin">3. Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his place.</note> is Contentment in his place; this is a Duty neceſſary to your own Happineſs, neceſſary to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of your Maſter, and neceſſary to the Honour of God; <hi>To your own Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> for though your Circumſtances
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:96201:41"/>
be never ſo good, yet if you do not think 'em ſo, you muſt needs be unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; and diſcontent doubles the weight and burden of any Service; <hi>To the Service of your Maſter,</hi> for you can never ſerve him well, if you do not ſerve him chearfully, and from the heart, which you can never do, whilſt you are ſick of your Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Laſtly, <hi>To the Honour of God,</hi> which requires, that you ſubmit to the Wiſdom of his Providence, and not murmure and repine at his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations: This Humility is a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue ſo conſonant to common Reaſon, that 'tis juſt matter of wonder how any ſhould be guilty of the contrary; for though we ſhould not be able to give a Reaſon of God's dealings with us, yet ſure the Reverence we have for his Infinite Wiſdom, and the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we have of his Infinite Goodneſs, may eaſily induce us to believe, that he has always a kind and good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for what he doth; and ſurely, you that look upon it as your Duty, to execute the Commands of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, without demanding the Reaſons
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:96201:41"/>
or Motives of 'em, cannot but think it reaſonable to treat God with as much Reverence and Humility as you do a mortal man. I might in the next place, put you in mind, that all we poſſeſs is owing merely to the favour of God, not to your Merit, and that he that has leaſt, has much more than he deſerves, and if ſo, you have no reaſon to complain of him, as if he had dealt niggardly with you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has dealt more bountifully with others; May he not do what he will with his own? but there are two Motives to Contentment, which I would more eſpecially recommend to you; <hi>One</hi> is, that whatever you undergo in this World, ſhall be made up and recompenſed to you a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-fold in another, if you ſuffer with Meekneſs, Patience and Humility: So that this ſtate of Humiliation doth but put you into a capacity of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter degrees of Glory hereafter. The <hi>other</hi> is, that if you conſider your ſtate aright, you have no reaſon at all of murmuring againſt God, as deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unequally with you; for in all
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:96201:42"/>
theſe things, which are ſubſtantially good and valuable, he has dealt as bountifully with you as with others: You enjoy the Light of the Sun; the Beauties of the Creation are as much expos'd to your view, as to any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's, the freſhneſs of the Air, the coolneſs of the Stream, the fragrancy of the Spring are imparted as bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to you, as any others who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. You have Rational and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits, healthy, ſtrong and active Bodies; the Food that is beſt for health, the Raiment that is beſt for for warmth, is every where to be had; the things wherein God has made a difference between you and others, are trifles, imaginary, and phantaſtick, not real Advantages; but you take pains for what you have; your <hi>Labour</hi> is not half ſo great a burden to you, as is their <hi>Idleneſs</hi> to them: But even of thoſe things which I call ſubſtantial bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, they enjoy more than you. 'Tis true, but you enjoy enough, and more than enough, like Manna, breeds but Worms, that is, troubles and cares:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:96201:42"/>
And this puts me in mind that the ſtate of a Servant has ſome Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages really and truly above that of a Maſter. Not to mention that Obedience it ſelf is not only a much plainer, but alſo a much eaſier Duty than Government, that it has nothing in it diſobliging, or unkind, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, Chaſtiſement, and putting away of Servants has, that it is no way reſponſible for the diſcretion of its actions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not to mention, I ſay, theſe and ſuch like Advantages which you poſſeſs, there are others of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter importance. You enjoy the World without the Cares of it; Storms ſink no Ships of yours, nor ſcorching Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours blaſt your Fruit or Corn; the Turns and Changes of Fortune con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you very little, or not at all; and I do very much queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your travail and labour, as well as your care, be not much leſs than that of many Maſters. 'Tis true, there are a ſort of men who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Idleneſs and Looſeneſs as the Prerogatives of an ample Fortune, envy 'em not; you ought rather to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:96201:43"/>
bleſs God that he has hedg'd in your ways, that he has put you in a ſtate of Life, wherein it is extremely difficult for you to be large or intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, to be proud or wanton; for ſurly 'tis a bleſſed Advantage belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to your condition, that it has fewer incitements to ſin, and more to Virtue than that of the Rich and Great: But of this I have diſcours'd at large in the beginning of this Chapter. There remains then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for you to quarrel at, in the condition and quality of a Servant, unleſs you think it too mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible for you in the Eye of the World; but why ſhould you think that Condition too mean for you, which our dear Lord thought not too mean for him? <hi>For he came in the form of a Servant, Phil.</hi> 2. But if this trouble you, I have ſhewed you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an infallible way of redeeming your ſelves from Contempt; namely, by a Religious and excellent Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; for true Virtue is much more honourable than Nobility of Blood, or Ampleneſs of Fortune.</p>

               <p>I Think,<note place="margin">Injuſtice or Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs in Servants implies a double guilt.</note> nothing can be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, than that every Servant owes his Maſter and Miſtreſs in the <hi>firſt place</hi> all thoſe Duties, at leaſt, which every Man owes another, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be Friend or Enemy, Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour or Stranger, namely, Truth, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Charity; nay, I believe, all will readily confeſs, that the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of theſe Duties in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants towards their Maſters and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, has many more and greater Aggravations in it, than any Errour of this kind, in one Man towards another; for the nearer any Relation is, the ſtricter is its obligation to thoſe Virtues. Two things do evidently aggravate the guilt of a Servants In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice or Uncharitableneſs: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Truſt repos'd in Servants makes it much more eaſie for them to do
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:96201:47"/>
wrong, and much more difficult for their Maſters to guard themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Obligation Servants lie under to Gratitude for the Benefits they enjoy, and to Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity enjoyn'd 'em by the Law of God and Nature, muſt needs render any wrong they do their Maſters or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, a more abominable Crime in the ſight of God and Man, as being not only a ſin of Injuſtice and Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs, which is of it ſelf a ſin big enough to damn any man; but alſo of the fouleſt Ingratitude, and baſeſt Treachery and Perfidiouſneſs: This, I would have well conſider'd, becauſe, if it were, it would make Servants dread the commiſſion of ſome Crimes which they ſeem not to have that ſenſe of, which they ought: Such are for inſtance, raiſing Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Feuds in the Family, by ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and whiſpering. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Credit and Reputation of their Maſters and Miſtreſſes, whether by falſe or true Reports; the guilt of theſe practices will be evident to him who conſiders. The ſpreading Report,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:96201:47"/>
though true, to another's diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, is <hi>uncharitableneſs</hi> in any man; but in a Servant, 'tis not only a breach of Charity, but of Faith and Secrecy too, and the blackeſt Ingratitude to boot; and if it be a ſin to ſpread an Uncharitable Truth, how much a greater to forge a Malicious Lye? For one Neighbour or one Stranger to belie or ſlander another by a falſe Charge, is an effect &amp; property not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a mean, but <hi>deviliſh</hi> ſpirit; what name then can this ſin find, when a Maſter or a Miſtreſs is thus treated by a Servant, who lies under not only the general Obligations of Charity, Truth and Juſtice, but alſo more particular, and if it can be more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ones, of Secrecy, Faith and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude? The ſame thing may be ſaid of kindling ſtrife; for if it be a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous wickedneſs in any one to ſtir up Contention by Lying and Whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how much more in a Servant, who is ſo ſtrictly obliged to preſerve the Peace of the Family he lives in?</p>
               <p>The very ſame is the caſe of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in all other Injuries committed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:96201:48"/>
againſt his Maſter; they are not only Violations of his Chriſtian Profeſſion, (as every act of Injuſtice or Unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs in all other men is) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the particular Obligations of his Calling; and therefore ſuch ſins, as they have greater aggravations, ſo ſhall they receive greater puniſhment than other men's: This is extremely neceſſary to be remembred, that, as you have eaſier opportunities of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wrong, ſo you may alſo have greater dread and horrour of it, as looking upon every Injury that were but a ſingle act of Injuſtice or Defect of Charity in others, as a Complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſins and villanies in you, being a tranſgreſſion not only of your Duty as Chriſtians, but as Servants too.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:96201:49"/>
obey in all things your Maſters according to the fleſh, not with eye-ſervice as men-pleaſers, but in ſingleneſs of heart fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. And whatſoever ye do, do it heartily, as unto the Lord, and not unto men: Knowing that of the Lord ye ſhall receive the Reward of the Inheritance, for ye ſerve the Lord Chriſt: But he that doth wrong, ſhall receive for the wrong which he has done; and there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe is <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable other Texts of Scripture; by all this put together, you may eaſily diſcern how grievous a ſin the Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of Servants is, 'tis a down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right contempt of God's revealed Will; 'tis a violation of the Law of Nature, diſturbing that juſt and wiſe Government which the Providence of God has introduced into the World, by that difference he has put between the ſeveral Ranks of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; 'tis a manifeſt breach of the Servant's Covenant which he entred into with his Maſter, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the Diſobedient Servant has no right to the Bread he eats, or to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:96201:49"/>
the Wages he receives, and he can expect nothing from God, who is the Supreme Lord of all, and by whoſe Appointment, the Diſtinction and Order which now is in the World was eſtabliſht; but ſome ſevere Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as upon an unrighteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and a Covenant-breaker; and 'tis no wonder, that God ſhould ſo ſtrictly exact this Duty, or ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſh the Violation of it; for this ſin of Diſobedience proceeds from Pride, or Frowardneſs, or Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ends in Wrath, and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Confuſion.</p>
               <p>Nor is the Spirit of God in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture content only to enjoyn Servants Obedience,<note place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of this Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> but it takes care to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint 'em, what kind of Obedience this muſt be: <hi>Firſt,</hi> It muſt be in all things, that is, all things that are not repugnant to the Will of God, who is our ſupreme Maſter; or the Laws of the Land, which are ſtampt with an Authority ſuperior to that of their Maſter in all things elſe. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are not to diſpute nor inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, but obey the Commands of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:96201:50"/>
their Maſter, for they are not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for the diſcretion or reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Commands. Their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience <hi>Secondly,</hi> muſt be <hi>in ſingleneſs of heart, not with eye-ſervice, as men-pleaſers.</hi> He is a very ill Servant who obeys only when his diſobedience cannot be concealed or excus'd; for at this rate, the Maſter would be the greateſt Drudge in his Family, and the Care and Toil of overſeeing others in their work, would be more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable than the work it ſelf. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Obedience muſt be perform'd <hi>from the heart;</hi> the Servant muſt not only do his Duty, and do it honeſtly, but he muſt do it willingly and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, without this he will not be like to be very proſperous, exact, or dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in his Service; nor can his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice prove very acceptable to his Maſter; for to all ingenious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, the Affection and Zeal of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is as valuable as his Service; ſo that for want of this, he will incur two great Evils, his Labour will be harder, and his Reward will be leſs: To all this, muſt be added <hi>Fourthly,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:96201:50"/>
Humility;</hi> Self-conceit and Impatience are the moſt improper qualities in a Servant imaginable; for what can be more abſurd than Pride and Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in one whoſe very profeſſion 'tis to obey? Theſe are grievous ſins in any Fortune, but more extremely grievous in a low one. The Scripture therefore doth not permit the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to <hi>anſwer</hi> again when reproved or blamed; nay, what is more, it commands him to behave himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully towards the <hi>froward</hi> and <hi>peeviſh,</hi> as well as <hi>mild</hi> and <hi>gentle</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and to<note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.</note> ſuffer <hi>patiently</hi> when he ſuffers <hi>wrongfully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That you may perform this Duty as you ought,<note place="margin">Means of performing this Duty.</note> you are to endeavour to perſuade your ſelves, that an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, honeſt, and chearful Obedience, is the glory of a Servant; that this is as much the honour of your ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as Prudence, Liberality and Gentleneſs is of the Maſters: That the meanneſs of any buſineſs you are imploy'd in, cannot ſo much diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage you, as Murmuring and Pride; for 'tis the Maſter's, not the Servant's
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:96201:51"/>
diſhonour, if he exacts what is not fit or becoming at the hands of his Servant: No Servant can ever looſe himſelf by his <hi>Humility,</hi> for he may with expreſſions of reſpect and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs quit his Service when he will, and ſo avoid any Rudeneſs or Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency; nor can I poſſibly conceive, that this courſe can be prejudicial to any Servant, for let the Servant be of the higheſt Rank, and the buſineſs commanded of the loweſt and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, any man may do that once or twice out of Humility, which yet he cannot take upon him as his conſtant work without the imputation of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimity or meanneſs of Spirit. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Servant muſt endeavour to entertain a good Opinion of, and Value for his Maſter, for otherwiſe it will not be eaſie to obey thoſe whom you can think reaſonable to deſpiſe. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And above all, the Servant muſt perſuade himſelf, that he obeys God in obeying his Maſter; he muſt look upon himſelf as placed in this ſtation by God, and he muſt look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Maſter as inveſted with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:96201:51"/>
over him by God, and this will be an encouragement to him to do his Duty, and a comfort and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to him when he ſuffers wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Duty which a Servant owes his Maſter is Faithfulneſs,<note place="margin">2 Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without which 'tis impoſſible that the Maſter can enjoy any real plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or ſatisfaction, or the Servant any peace of Conſcience; for how can the Maſter's mind be at eaſe, if he be not ſecure of the Faith of thoſe of his own Family, but muſt needs ſuſpect thoſe whom he muſt needs truſt? and what an ulcer'd gauled Conſcience muſt that Servant have, who dwells continually under the Roof, and eats daily of the Bread of that man whom he wrongs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures, where every thing he doth or ſees calls his ſin to remembrance, and every Benefit, every Favour is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and a ſtab to his Soul? Now this Fidelity is to be practiſed in all thoſe things, wherein the Maſter is capable of receiving any Benefit by the Faith, or ſuffering any wrong by
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:96201:52"/>
the Falſhood of his Servant; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, it ought to be underſtood, that Fidelity obliges the Servant not only, not to do his Maſter any wrong himſelf, but alſo not to ſuffer any others to do him any. Fidelity taken in this large extent compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends a great many Duties of the Servant towards his Maſter. As for Example,<note place="margin">Fidelity towards his Maſter's Soul.</note> 
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That he endeavour, as far as it lies in him, to promote the Virtue, and procure the Salvation of his Maſter, for this is his trueſt and greateſt Intereſt: This he may effect, partly by Prayer to God for him, partly by Advice and good Diſcourſe; if his Maſter give him any ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, or admit him into any ſuch freedom: Partly like <hi>Serapion,</hi> by the Example of an excellent Life, but if he cannot ſerve him this way, he muſt at leaſt take care that he be not guilty of the contrary; he muſt not be an Incentive to, or Inſtrument of his ſin; he muſt not be a Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of, or Purveyor for his Luſt; he muſt not flatter and applaud him in his wickedneſs; for this is the worſt
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:96201:52"/>
ſort of unfaithfulneſs, the betraying the very Soul of his Maſter, and how wretched a ſtate doth the Servant reduce himſelf to by this perfidiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if his Maſter never repents, he has drawn upon his own Soul the guilt of his Damnation; if he do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, he draws upon himſelf his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters perpetual contempt and averſion. <hi>Secondly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Towards the Peace and Honour of his Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> The Servant muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to preſerve the Peace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Maſter, for theſe things are or ſhould be dear to every one next to his Soul and Virtue. Now the Peace of a Maſter may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd either by the Contentions of thoſe of his Family amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or by their unkindneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dutifulneſs towards himſelf; the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant therefore who by lyes or ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by vile whiſperings and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations doth alienate the Affections of the Family, or any Member of it, from their Head, or ſets them at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance between one another, is guilty of the blackeſt treachery, for he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſly robs his Maſter of the Peace of his mind, and the Affections of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:96201:53"/>
thoſe of his Houſhold, than both which, nothing can be dearer to him: Nor is this all the aggravation of this ſin, for it loads the perfidious wretch with all the guilt of the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and great miſchiefs which always may, and very often do enſue upon the Contentions and Diviſions of Families. In a word, ſuch a one draws upon himſelf the Wrath of God, and as ſoon as he is diſcovered, the diſpleaſure and hatred of the whole Family. As to the Honour of their Maſter or Miſtreſs, it may be wounded by the Servant two ways. <hi>Firſt,</hi> by ſpeaking ill of 'em either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad or at home; or elſe <hi>Secondly,</hi> by promoting that Immorality in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, which muſt neceſſarily tend to their diſparagement and ſcandal: They therefore that will be Faithful in this point, muſt be ſo far from making the faults of their Maſter or Miſtreſs publick, that if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they muſt not ſee 'em them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they muſt be ſo far from making 'em the ſubject of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe abroad, that they muſt vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:96201:53"/>
'em all that poſſibly they can; nay, they muſt not endure any ſuch ſort of Talk at home; they muſt no more connive at a Fellow-Servant that wrongs their Maſter or Miſtreſs in their Honour, than if they did wrong 'em in their Goods; they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe whatever will admit of excuſe, what will not, they muſt hate but not ſpread or cenſure; by doing this, a Servant ſhall gain true Honour to himſelf, while he preſerves his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; for though the ill temper of ſome people be ſuch, that they are pleaſed with malicious Informations, with ſpiteful and ſlanderous Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, yet I never knew any temper ſo bad, that loved the Informer, if a Servant; for they cannot but judge Ingratitude and Treachery as odious Vices in him, as are any that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns in his Maſter.<note place="margin">Towards the goods and poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of his Maſter.</note> The <hi>Third</hi> and laſt thing wherein the Faithfulneſs of a Servant is required, is the goods and poſſeſſions of the Maſter; in theſe the Servant muſt not wrong his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, neither by theft, nor fraud, nor waſt, nor muſt he ſuffer others to do
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:96201:54"/>
ſo, for all this is downright Injuſtice, and expreſly forbid by Almighty God. Thus <hi>Titus</hi> 2.10. They are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to <hi>purloin,</hi> as being directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> which they are commanded to ſhew; nor is the conſuming the Maſter's goods by Riot and Intemperance, by unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Waſt, or by Sloth and Careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, one jot a leſs ſin than Theft or Fraud. The unjuſt Steward in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. is accuſed, that <hi>he had waſted his Maſters goods;</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, if Parents had brought a Son before the Congregation, and accuſed him of theſe Crimes, he was to be ſtoned.<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 21.20.</note> 
                  <hi>This our Son is ſtubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our Voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard; and all the men of his City ſhall ſtone him with ſtones that he die.</hi> And ſurely a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſlothful Servant is no leſs pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable than a wicked and ſlothful Son. I will inſiſt a little longer upon the Servant's Duty in this point of Juſtice, both becauſe the Servant is more apt to offend this way, being betrayed by the Temptation either
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:96201:54"/>
of profit or pleaſure, and becauſe the Maſter is wont to reſent offences of this nature moſt heinouſly, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count 'em as the worſt of Injuries he is capable of ſuffering by his Servant, not (I hope) that he doth eſteem his Goods above his Soul or his Honour, or above the Virtue and Peace of his Family, but becauſe he is leſs able to ſecure the one than the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the perfidiouſneſs of Servants; for if he be a good man, he will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be able to ſecure himſelf and his Family againſt the ſlander by which any Servant endeavours to blaſt his Honour, or againſt the Lies and Whiſpers by which he endeavours to breed diſcontent, or againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his ill Morals; but there is no way to ſecure himſelf againſt the wrongs which he may ſuffer by the Fraud and Purloyning, by the Waſt and Riot, or by the Sloth and Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of an unfaithful Servant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore of <hi>Purloyning.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">of Purloin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> By this is to be underſtood, the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the goods of your Maſter to your own uſe; you cannot be ſo ignorant
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:96201:55"/>
as not to know, that this is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Theft, and forbid by an expreſs Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal:</hi> Nor can you be ignorant, that Theft is a Crime of the fouleſt nature, as being not only repugnant to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and perfections of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but even to the common Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Heathens, to the natural Law of Juſtice, <hi>Thou ſhalt do to others, as thou wouldeſt be done by;</hi> and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know, how outragiouſly you would your ſelves reſent ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; for if you love the World ſo well, as to venture the being damn'd for it, 'tis eaſie for me to conclude, how grievouſly you would take it, to be robbed of it by another. How vile a ſin this is, in the Opinion of others, may eaſily be inferr'd from the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſtain and infamy which ſticks upon it amongſt all people, and from the ſevere puniſhments pronounc'd againſt it in all civiliz'd Nations; but moſt of all, from the puniſhment which a wiſe and a merciful, as well as juſt God adjudges it to.

Can you think, that he by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming your Maſter forfeits his Right and Property, and is no longer under the fence and protection of the Laws of God? or can you think, that you, by becoming a Servant, gain a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to commit that ſin with <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> which you could not have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe done without incurring <hi>Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>

Is not the Injuſtice the ſame? Is not the wrong the Maſter ſuffers notorious? Nay, I muſt be free to tell you, that though the Injuſtice and Wrong be the ſame, the guilt and ſin of Theft is not the ſame in a Stranger and a Servant: Or doſt thou think that baſe Ingratitude, and perfidious breach of Truſt, adds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the guilt of the Injuſtice? Poor creature! Doſt thou not ſee, how vile a ſin thou doſt commit, a ſin that nothing can attend, if it have it's due, but reproach and infamy, bodily puniſhment according to Law, and, if not repented of, Eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Nay doſt thou not diſcern what a heap of ſins thou art guilty of in one, Ingratitude, breach of Truſt, Lying, and, it may be, Perjury together with Injuſtice in every ſingle act of this ſort of Theft? And what art thou to gain by all this? What is it that thou ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteſt as the price of thy Honour, thy Life and thy Soul?

To this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand take this anſwer, I ſhould never have fancied this Objection, had I not been extreamly ſenſible of the frailty of Man; for, whence ſhould any one doubt, whether he ſhould preſerve his Faith and Duty to his Maſter, or commit a ſin to oblige a Fellow-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant? Whence ſhould ſpring this queſtion, whether you ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and cheriſh a wicked Fellow-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in his Vice, or whether you ſhould preſerve a Maſter, (to whom you ow Fidelity, Truth and Love,) from injuries and wrongs? How fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſhould a Man come to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with this ſcruple? Whether he ſhould preſerve his Integrity, a good Conſcience, and the Favour and Bleſſing of God by doing his Duty, or, by deſerting it, run the hazard of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:96201:60"/>
the worſt that the wit or malice of his wicked Fellow-Servant can bring upon him? Theſe you muſt readily acknowledge are doubts and ſcruples, which do not become the ſincerity and Faith of a good and honeſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: However, you ſhall not want here the beſt advice that I can give you, for I know, there may be ſome little ſtruglings of good nature and intereſt, in oppoſition to your Duty in this point; the firſt thing then, you are to do, is to reprove your guilty Fellow-Servant, to lay before him, as well as you can, the hainouſneſs of his ſin, together with the danger of it, both with reſpect to his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral and Eternal Intereſt, acquaint him with the Beauty and Pleaſure, the ſecurity and advantage of Vertue and the Fear of God, adviſe and exhort him earneſtly to expiate his ſin by Repentance towards God, and reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution towards man, mix this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof ever and anon with Profeſſions of tenderneſs and affections for him, with expreſſions of your good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſincere intention, which he
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:96201:60"/>
may diſcern by your accuſing him only to himſelf, and laſtly with aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, that, if he follow your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he ſhall not ſuffer the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, either in his credit or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt by your knowledge of his fault, nay, that it ſhall not diminiſh in the leaſt your reſpect or Affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him: For you are not inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the wiles of the Devil, and the infirmity of man, it being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly incident to humane frailty to fall into ſin, and 'tis the work of a true Faith to repent of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as your compaſſion is kindled in you upon the former account, ſo ſhould you neceſſarily be ingaged to honour and love him upon the latter, now if you prove ſucceſsful in this, you gain a Soul to God, a good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to your Maſter, and an inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Friend to your ſelf, and what is more than all, you gain peace and ſatisfaction to your Conſcience, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the bleſſing of God, the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the increaſe of his Holy Spirit. Whereas ſuppoſe you connive at, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:96201:61"/>
he proceed in his ſin, Ah! How fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal an obligation do you lay upon him! You incourage him in his ſin, and, if he never repent, you damn his Soul Eternally; if he do repent, how muſt he needs condemn you in the bitterneſs and grief of his Reflections, as one falſe to God and him, and no leſs unfaithful to his Eternal, than your Maſter's Temporal Intereſt? And what the guilt is, that you load your own Conſcience with, I have ſhewed you before: But if you would do any good this way, you muſt take care, that you do it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and that you do not let his fault take air before you have thus repreſented it to him, for if you firſt publiſh, and then reprove his guilt, I cannot wonder, if he do queſtion either your ſincerity or diſcretion, and his doubting of either muſt needs forfeit in him all reſpect for your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or reproof, and tempt him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſtand upon his defence, than truſt you with his Confeſſion or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>If you can effect nothing this way
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:96201:61"/>
towards the reclaiming your Fellow-Servant, you muſt communicate his offence with ſome body elſe; as well that you may your ſelf avoid the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Connivance and Conſent, as alſo that you may deliver, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, his Soul from guilt without the ruin of his Credit and Fortune: And in the choice of ſuch a Perſon, you are, if it may be, to find out ſome one that is conſiderable with him, one whoſe Vertue and Authority he Reverences, and whoſe Affection and Diſcretion he can confide in; this will make him more apt to be free in his Confeſſion, and if he has any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, any ingenuity left in him, he cannot but be wrought by this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod into Repentance. This very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod may be made uſe of in other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as well as this, as in thoſe injuries you ſee your Maſter ſuffer, either by the negligence or waſt of your Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Servants, only where the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is little and trifling, you are not to communicate it with others, for this will look like a formal and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn impertinence, but if he refuſe

               <p>A ſecond Vice of Servants,<note place="margin">Of Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> by which a Maſter ſuffers is negligence, by which I mean, either a total O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or neglect of Duty, or ſuch a careleſs and lazy performance of it, that it were as good left undone, as be thus done: Or elſe, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs or want of care. Now tho' this be very common, you cannot, upon due examination of the nature of this fault, but confeſs it a very great one; for as to the Maſter, (if he be hereby endamag'd) is it not the ſame thing for him to ſuffer by your negligence as fraud? And I need not tell you, where there is much truſt or confidence on the Maſter's ſide, and no Induſtry or Care on the Servant's, that all muſt neceſſarily go to wrack and ruin: Or if he ſuffer not in his intereſt, he muſt ſuffer in the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96201:63"/>
peace and contentment of his mind, for there cannot be a greater plague and vexation to any man than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident and careleſs Servant: Nor is it a ſmall matter, that the Maſter is forced to bear the rudeneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt which a Servant's heedleſneſs and idleneſs is too plain an expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of, 'tis a troubleſom thing to a man to be levelled with his own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, yet ſo he is in this caſe, for if there be no authority in the Maſter, nor fear or care in the Servant, if tho' the Maſter may command, the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servant will perform only what he pleaſes, 'tis hard to ſay wherein is the difference and diſtinction between 'em. Is it poſſible for any Servant to think, that this is to do his Duty? Can any one think that this is <hi>to obey with fear and trembling?</hi> Can any one think that this ſluggiſhneſs is any thing better than <hi>Eye-Service,</hi> ſo much condemned by God? Can any one who carries himſelf thus heedleſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver perſuade himſelf, that he doth ſervice as if he made it to <hi>God not Man?</hi> Or can he ever have the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:96201:63"/>
to expect a reward from God for this kind of Deportment? What ſuch a one has reaſon to expect, he may learn from the Parable of the Lord and his Servants, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. where he is called a wicked and a ſlothful Servant, and adjudged to <hi>outer Darkneſs,</hi> who had not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the truſt committed to him, who had only behaved himſelf idly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably, tho' he had neither wrong'd his Maſter by fraud or theft, or waſt, and riot. Alas! The unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Servant muſt not flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that he doth his Duty, for care and induſtry are as eſſential and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary parts of the <hi>Faithfulneſs</hi> of a Servant, as truth and honeſty, and he that any time ſtands idle can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be excus'd, unleſs he can plead, what they in the Market-place did to that queſtion, <hi>Why ſtand ye here idle all the day long? Becauſe no man has hired us.</hi> But you are hired, you have no doubt work to do, for no Maſter will purchaſe heedleſneſs and ſloth at the rate of ſuch a charge as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant puts him to: Nor can I think
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:96201:64"/>
that a Servant himſelf would judge this behaviour a good diſcharge of any man's Duty in any other Station: Would he think <hi>that</hi> Maſter did his Duty, who made no proviſion for his Family? And yet care and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is as indiſpenſible a Duty of the Servant, as proviſion or maintenance of the Maſter: But I need ſay no more, if nothing elſe will, the effects of this ill demeanour may convince a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, how great an evil this is, for beſides the loſs and vexation which it creates the Maſter, it begets perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual quarrels and diſcontents in the Family, for the Fellow-Servants of a ſluggard are not only bereav'd of that aſſiſtance which they ſhould receive from him, but alſo oppreſſed by that burden of which he eaſes his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; the Drone himſelf is forced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many Lies and Shifts to excuſe his omiſſions and errors, and finally after ſome time ſpent in the diſpleaſure of his Maſter, the contempt and hatred of his Fellow-Servants: He is at laſt reproachfully caſt off, and branded with ſuch a character as makes all

that know him, ſhut their Doors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, as unwilling to receive ſuch a trouble and incumbrance into their Families.</p>

future want, or whether he rob and plunder him out of Luxury and Riot, if ſo, then you may be ſure, that if the wrong be the ſame in reſpect of the Maſter, and the guilt the ſame in reſpect of the Servant, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral ill conſequences of it in this Life, and the puniſhment of it in another, will be much the ſame; for ſuch Servants muſt finally without Repentance and Amendment, be abandoned and forſaken by God and Man: And accordingly 'tis generally obſerv'd, and I have mark't it my ſelf, that ſuch as have been extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prodigal, Wanton and Waſtful, in their Maſter's Houſes, have been afterwards reduced to extream Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, even to the want of a Morſel of Bread; and that which adds to their miſery in this ſtate, is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that ſuch as have been ſharers with 'em in the waſt of their Maſter's goods, have been the moſt apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach their former Pride and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, and to deſpiſe their preſent Poverty, and the only Perſons from whom they could expect relief, have

been thoſe very Maſters and Miſtreſſes whom they had before abus'd and wrong'd.</p>
               <p>Beſides this Duty of Juſtice in <hi>Deed,</hi> there is another ſort of Juſtice in <hi>Word,</hi> which a Servant owes his Maſter, which is <hi>Truth;</hi> but becauſe this is a common and avow'd Duty between Man and Man, I think 'tis not needful to dwell upon it here, there is no body can be ignorant of the wickedneſs of this ſin which makes one of the greateſt Prerogatives of Mankind, that is, Speech, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of the greateſt Miſchiefs; which is 2dly, An Argument of a mean baſe Spirit, and deſtitute of the Faith and Fear of God; which is 3dly, The Product and Effect of ſome ſin or other, for Virtue never needs the Service or Protection of a Lye; which <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Prevents Repentance for ſin; for as ſoon as men have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a great ſlight and dexterity in Lying, they grow hard and confident in their faults, becauſe they find they can without any difficulty conceal or excuſe 'em by a Lye.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:96201:66"/>And as no one can be ignorant of the evil of this ſin, ſo neither of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil which will puniſh it: Who knows not how many plagues are denounc'd againſt it by God? What infamy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it from Man? What ſecret ſhame and diſquiet it tortures the mind with? and finally, how it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly involves the Lyar in Temporal and Eternal Ruine? Let the Servant therefore, as he would avoid all this, alwaies keep up to ſtrict Truth in his words; if he have committed a fault, let him not go about to excuſe it, by the commiſſion of a greater, that is, by Lying; let him rather chuſe to try the goodneſs of his Maſter by an humble and honeſt confeſſion, than tempt him to ſuſpicion by frivolous Excuſes, or barefaced Untruths; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if he ſhould think his Maſter ſtupid enough to be impoſed on by any idle Tale, yet let him remember that he has a Maſter in Heaven who may be conquer'd by Confeſſion and Repentance, but cannot be impoſed upon, or mockt by any ſlight or arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of words.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:96201:66"/>I have now ſpoke ſufficiently of the Duty of <hi>Faithfulneſs,</hi> and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſs on to the</p>

                  <hi>Third</hi> and laſt great Duty of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,<note place="margin">3dly, Of Love of Maſters and Miſtreſſes.</note> 
                  <hi>The Love of their Maſters and Miſtreſſes:</hi> This is a Virtue which is extremely neceſſary in Servants, it being a very difficult matter to do their Duty without it; but if this be once implanted in their hearts; if the Maſter be lookt upon as a Father, one whoſe Affection and Eſteem for 'em they value as their greateſt worldly happineſs, there will need no other motive either to their Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence or Faithfulneſs: For what St. <hi>John</hi> obſerves concerning the Service of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. that to them who love him, <hi>his Commandments are not grievous;</hi> the ſame is true of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Man, the burden of it is very light, if Love help to bear it; for how natural is it for a Servant to obey when he is as fond of the Love of his Maſter, as of his own Intereſt? and how natural to be faithful, when he loves his Maſters Intereſt as his own? He will abhor to ſee him wrong'd in
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:96201:67"/>
his Goods, or diſturb'd or diſquieted in his Mind, ſince if he loves him, he cannot but in every evil that befalls him, ſuffer with him; how ſacred will ſuch a Servant eſteem the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Maſter? How much will he be concern'd for the Virtue of his Children, the good behaviour of his fellow-ſervants, and the ſucceſs of his Enterprizes in the World? Such a Servant will not ſtand upon Puncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lioes, and nicely weigh his Duty by grains and ſcruples; but he will think <hi>all</hi> his Duty (whatever it be) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he can ſerve his Maſter: And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he does, he will perform with that delight, that care and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that one would think that he were like <hi>Eliezer</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> rather an Heir of his Maſter's bleſſing, and his own labours, than an hired Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; ſuch a one will not ſtay to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect commands, where his Maſter's intereſt requires his Service, much leſs will he be ſolicitous, which way he may be excuſed from his Duty, for he accounts nothing more diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious than to ſtand in need of an
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:96201:67"/>
excuſe. <hi>Finally;</hi> how eaſy will it be for ſuch a Servant to receive direction humbly, to bear any infirmity of his Maſter patiently, to anſwer reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, to remember heedfully, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form carefully, and to do <hi>all</hi> out of <hi>ſingleneſs of Heart?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How many and great the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of this Virtue are, both to the Maſter and to the Servant, both in point of credit and delight, both in point of Religion and Intereſt, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſy to be diſcern'd; the Maſter will have his buſineſs done, and that very proſperouſly; he ſees nothing miſcarry under the hands of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, he hears no diſcontent nor contention in his Family, he ſees that his Servant is a good example and guide to his whole Houſhold; in a word, he meets with nothing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him when at home, nor is he diſturb'd by any ſuſpicions or fears when abroad; for he can as entirely confide in his Servant's Faith and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as in himſelf; how will ſuch a man be ready like him, who bought <hi>Diogenes</hi> to run out into the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:96201:68"/>
Exchange and Market, to publiſh to the World that a Guardian Angel is come into his Houſe? Without any Amplification of the matter, ſuch a Maſter, if he be not ſavage and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as well as ſtupid, muſt confeſs that he enjoys a great bleſſing, that he cannot ſet too high a value upon his Servant, and by conſequence, he is in Honour and Juſtice bound not only to treat him with courteous words and kind looks, but to reward him too, and this cannot but tend to the honour and intereſt of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, which cannot but reflect advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſly upon the Maſter, for to have good Servants, and to do well for 'em, is, I think, in the opinion of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious men, no ſmall argument of a good and wiſe man: But to proceed, not only the credit and intereſt, but even the content and Religion of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies is highly concern'd in the love and Duty of Servants; for Love is the Parent of Unity and Peace, and it Nurſes up the Children it brings forth, it maintains and preſerves the quiet which it procures, and in a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:96201:68"/>
where Charity and Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reign, where order and peace dwell, how neceſſarily muſt Religion thrive and flouriſh? They will watch over and aſſiſt one another, they will affectionately give, and meekly receive advice, they will not want time for Religious Duties, nor a ſedate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of mind to make the beſt uſe of that time; no one's Prayers and Reading will be rendred uſeleſs through diſcontent and diſtraction: No one will be kept back from the Sacrament by confuſion of buſineſs, or diſturbance of mind: If all this be put together, I need not trouble you with many motives or inducements to this Duty of Love, for what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bleſſings can a Servant deſire than thoſe are, which this gives him? 'Tis a help to him in the performance of his Duty, lightens the burden of his Service, it gives him the love of his Maſter and the Family, peace at home, credit and reputation abroad, both which are the moſt ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of a Servant's intereſt imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, unleſs it be the favour of God;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:96201:69"/>
and this behaviour gives him a right claim to that too; for whatever is a work of Religion, as this indeed is, whatever procures men more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of grace, and whatever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares and diſpoſes 'em for the beſt uſe of 'em, muſt needs very much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our Heavenly Intereſt, and I have ſufficiently made it out, that all theſe are the bleſſed fruits of this Duty. To all which I will add but one conſideration more to convince you of your obligation to it, which is this, that you cannot without monſtrous ingratitude be guilty of the contrary: Do you think, that you owe no affection to your Maſter and Miſtreſs, who have receiv'd you into their Houſe, repoſed a confidence and truſt in you, who are very ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous to inform and inſtruct you, who not only bear long with your Ignorance, but wink at many other infirmities in you, who provide for you in your health, and are tender of you in your ſickneſs, who are deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to oblige and encourage you, and rejoice when you behave your

ſelves ſo as to deſerve it? Is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing due to 'em for their compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for your Souls, for their watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs over your manners, for their care in providing for you ſpiritual as well as bodily food? You cannot be guilty of hating or deſpiſing theſe who have deſerved ſo well of you, nay you cannot be guilty of what is leſs, the not loving 'em, but you muſt be profligately ingrateful, you muſt be ſtupid and baſe to a degree that bruitiſh Creatures have never yet been guilty of; <hi>For the Ox knows his Owner, and the Aſs his Maſter's Crib:</hi> Nay there is no beaſt of the Field, or of the Deſart ſo fierce and ſalvage, but he has been tamed and obliged too by repeated courteſies and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,</p>

                     <hi>O</hi> Holy and Juſt God, I know that without Holineſs it is impoſſible for me to pleaſe thee here, or to enjoy thee hereafter; I beſeech thee therefore, that my underſtanding may be ſo enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, my Conſcience convinced, and my whole Heart enflamed with the love of Holineſs, that I may be Holy in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Converſation: Beget in me a moſt tender and lively ſenſe of the great Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Obedience, Juſtice and Charity which I owe to my Maſter, that I go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning my ſelf by theſe in all my acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I may in my Station, advance the Honour of God, the Contentment and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of my Maſter, the Peace and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Family, and my own both Temporal and Eternal Happineſs. I know, O Lord, that no acts of injuſtice or unfaithfulneſs between Man and Man ſhall go unpuniſh'd, I know that for theſe things ſake, the wrath of God is reveal'd from Heaven, O what then muſt be my puniſhment, if I heap upon
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:96201:70"/>
the guilt of injuſtice and uncharitableneſs many others, namely, of Ingratitude, Unfaithfulneſs, Lying, Perjury. O pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me therefore, O my God, from all falſhood and wrong; and ſuffer me not to forfeit thy favour and deſtroy my Soul, for the ſake of thoſe things that periſh. O let me be fully convinced, that the ways of Righteouſneſs are ways of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and that all her paths are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity and Peace, that ſo I may delight my ſelf in the Law of my God, and may find comfort, and a bleſſing in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of my Duty: Teach me O Lord, Humility and Obedience, Faith and Truth, Care and Induſtry, Charity and Meekneſs, that I may adorn the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of God my Saviour, win others o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to a love of Virtue, and after an humble and contented, tho' laborious life here, may enter into Reſt and Glory hereafter, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

And O my God, becauſe I am to give an account to thee, who art the ſearcher of the Heart, and the tryer of the Reins, the Judge of my moſt ſecret Thoughts, as well as my moſt ſecret Actions, teach me therefore to do my Duty chearfully and in ſingleneſs of Heart; make me to abominate all Lying ſhifts and pretences, as well as all proud wilfulneſs and ſluggiſhneſs.

Servants muſt expreſs their Affection to their Maſters Children by a tender Care for their Morals, I do not mean, that they ſhould be Spies upon their Faults, but Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Aſſiſtants to their Virtues; This your Aid is to be afforded according to the Age and Capacity of the Children, they may inſtil into 'em early Inſtruction, in their green years; they may ſuggeſt to 'em their Duty, and excite and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade 'em to it, as they grow up to Eſtate of Reaſon; and all along they muſt take care, that they be no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96201:75"/>
of any Vice to them; neither of frowardneſs, nor lying, nor diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to thoſe of Tender Years; nor of Riot, Intemperance, Idleneſs, Pride, Prodigality and Wilfulneſs to thoſe of Riper; for all are much apter to imitate Vice than Virtue: But in ſtead of performing this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Service to their Maſter, it often happens that ſome Servants are the Corrupters of their Children's Youth; they miſlead 'em by their Examples, and prompt and inſtigate 'em to Sin both by word and deed: They fawn and flatter 'em into Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance and Self-conceipt, they not only conceal, but applaud their Errours, they inſtruct 'em how to play the looſe Gallant, and the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient Child, and are in a word ever ready to adviſe 'em not what is conſonant to their good, but to their humour and fancy. But you will ask me, how ſhall a Servant acquit himſelf, if his Maſters Child ſhould take ill courſes. What ſhall he do? If he oppoſe and reſiſt the Child what in him lies in the Progreſs of
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96201:76"/>
his Sin, he incurs his hatred; if he favour him in it, and aid him by ſecrecy and ſhelter, or any other way, he is unfaithful to his Maſter: there is no upright man who meaſures his Obligation to a Duty by the Event and Succeſs of it; every man that will have a peaceful Conſcience, muſt do what becomes him, and leave the Iſſue of it to God, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he muſt do it with all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion he can too, and his Duty will direct him here how to perform another Duty which ſeems harſh and hazardous; for Inſtance, in this Caſe Charity to the Son will ſo regulate the Servants Faith to his Maſter, that he ſhall not only do his Duty, but do it with true diſcretion: Thus Charity will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him, <hi>Firſt</hi> as to the nature of the Childs offence, that he is not to take notice of little frailties, and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable defects, much leſs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of 'em to his Parents; for this were, if not a peeviſh malignity of Spirit, yet at leaſt, a buſie and officious piece of Impertinence not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96201:76"/>
without ſome mixture of defect of Charity, but ſuch matters wherein the Virtue, the Honour, the Health, the Intereſt of the Child, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the happineſs and comfort of the Parent is concern'd, deſerve the Servants Care and Faith: but <hi>Secondly</hi> in Errours of this nature, Charity will teach him to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between a ſlip or fall, and a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led depravity of mind, or Vicious habit in the Child, ſo that, as he will not complain at all, of little and trifling Errours, ſo neither will he too ſoon of greater: and in the laſt place when he ſhall be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the Indiſpenſible Neceſſity of making known the fault of a Child, Charity will teach him, that he ſhould proceed in this with all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable mildneſs, not aggravating or amplifying the Crime, and that he ſhould uſe all imaginable Caution both to prevent any miſchievous effect of ſuch diſcovery, and to ſecure as much as in him lies, the good ſucceſs of it. And here Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſeems to me to point out the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96201:77"/>
way to this, and to tell you that <hi>Firſt</hi> you are to try what you can effect your ſelf by a modeſt humble &amp; affectionate Repreſentation to your young Maſter of the ſin and hazard wherein he is engaged, for if this may prevail, it were not ſo Charitable to bring him into peril of his Fathers diſpleaſure or diſeſteem; but if this ſort to no good end, you cannot be bound by Faith and Secrecy to your Young Maſter to betray your Faith and Duty to your Old, for this is in effect but to betray both: You muſt therefore either make known the Son's ill Courſes to his Father, or if there be apparent Reaſons to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend no good effects of this way, but rather ill ones for want of a well poiz'd judgment, or tolerable temper in the Father you muſt then put the buſineſs into the hands of ſome faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and diſcreet Friend, whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and good nature may ſo far mitigate the Violent Choler, and ſweeten the Implacable temper of the Father, that the Son's Virtue may be repaired without the Ruin
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:96201:77"/>
of his Fortune. I have in this Advice inſinuated, that as a Servant ought not to be peeviſh and impertinent in complaining of trifling faults, ſo neither ought he to be too forward in revealing greater, much leſs ought he to exaggerate and exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate the Crime: but my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not, that his Information ſhould want any one grain or ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of truth neceſſary to give the Friend or Father a right notion of the offence, nor yet that he ſhould delay the diſcovery of a fault, where the concealment breeds Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but if he cannot truſt his own Judgment in this point, and the Iſſue of his delay ſeem doubtful to him, he muſt then conſult ſome body elſe, whoſe Judgment he may better relie upon, and whoſe affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both to Father and Son, he can be very confident of. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who behaves himſelf thus in this caſe, acquits himſelf with a good Conſcience towards God and Man, he doth <hi>Both</hi> very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervice, for there can be nothing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:96201:78"/>
more acceptable to God, than the converting a ſinner from his evil way, nor to a Father, than the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a Child juſt on the brink of miſery, nor indeed to the Son, than the reſtoring him to his Virtue, &amp; the preſerving to him that Honour and Fortune which were both ready to ſuffer wreck: So that this Servant will hereby procure to himſelf the everlaſting good-will of his Maſter and Child, the Peace of his own mind, and the Bleſſing and Favour of God.<note place="margin">James 5.20.</note> * <hi>He that converteth a ſinner from the Errour of his way, ſhall ſave a Soul from Death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſins.</hi> Nor is he far remote from that bleſſed reward mention'd <hi>Daniel</hi> 12.3. <hi>They that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the Firmament; and they that turn many to Righteouſneſs; as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi> Whereas on the other ſide, that Servant who either cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts his Maſters Children, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords 'em his Aid and Aſſiſtance, his Shelter and Secrecy in their Vicious Courſes, betrays Man, falſifies his
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:96201:78"/>
Faith, not only to his Maſter, but his God; he doth the drudgery of his Maſter the Devil, who imploys all his Slaves in propagating ſin, and ſhall certainly one day receive the wages of his wickedneſs, even that Death which is denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt men of the moſt abominable Character; men<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1.32.</note> 
                  <hi>who not only do</hi> the worſt of things themſelves, <hi>but alſo have pleaſure in them that do 'em.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſaid enough to convince the Servant that he is to be careful of the Morals of his Maſters Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but there are two Virtues which he ought to have more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care of, being thoſe two which every Child ſhould be eminent in, which are in ſome ſort the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Guard of all the reſt, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a filial and dutiful Love of his Parents, and hearty affection to his Brethren; the Servant therefore, if there happen any breach or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of this mutual and Reciprocal Kindneſs between Father and Son, or Brethren, muſt do all that he can to repair it and make it up:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:96201:79"/>
But at leaſtwiſe if he cannot cloſe, he muſt not widen the Breach; <hi>Peace-makers are bleſſed,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Math. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Children of God.</hi> But they who ſow ſtrife and contention, are the Children of their Father the Devil; 'tis the Villanous Practice of ſome Servants to enkindle Emulation and Strife amongſt Brethren, and to take a ſide and party, when they have created a Faction to over-value one Child to the diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the reſt, and ſometimes to fill their Ears with Lyes and Tales, that they may alienate their Minds from their Brethren: And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the very ſame method is made uſe of to withdraw 'em from the Love and Duty which they owe their Parents, by poſſeſſing 'em of the partiality of the Father and Mother, amplifying their kindneſs towards one even to fondneſs and dotage, and aggravating their unkindneſs to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther even to coldneſs &amp; hatred: One while they will not ſtick to inſinuate the peeviſhneſs or jealouſi'e of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, another while they will mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:96201:79"/>
the Fortune of the young Heir, they will provoke him by laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the Liberty and Fineneſs of this or that Young Gentleman who is of a meaner Fortune than he, they will impute the ſtrictneſs and care of Parents to the Niggardlineſs of their Temper, the narrowneſs and Antiqueneſs of their Education, or to the natural Auſterity of old age, and thus they delude and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the ſilly and unexperienced youth, and make him ceaſe to be a Child to his Father, that he may be a ſlave to his Servant. Now I would earneſtly intreat Servants to lay this ſadly to heart, that theſe and ſuch like Practices are an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, that the more ſucceſsful they are in 'em, the more fatal they'l prove to 'em, for if they be not chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd in this world, they will be damn'd for 'em in another. Amongſt thoſe things which <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, the Lord hates, and are an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, you will meet a <hi>Lying Tongue,</hi> Prov. 6.17. <hi>and</hi> verſe 19. <hi>A falſe witneſs that ſpeaketh Lyes; and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:96201:80"/>
him that ſoweth diſcord among Brethren;</hi> Nor is it to be wondred at that God ſhould abominate ſuch a ſin as this is, for the miſchiefs that very commonly enſue upon ſuch diviſions and animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities between Brethren, or between Parents and Children, are not to be expreſſed: St. <hi>James</hi> tells us briefly, <hi>ch.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 16. <hi>Where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion and every evil work.</hi> And he certainly who alienates a Child from his Parent, thruſts him headlong into ſin and Ruine, and creates the Parent inſufferable vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſcontent. But ſuppoſe God would not exact an account of you for this ſin, what is it a Servant can propoſe to himſelf from all this miſchief? He may flatter himſelf with ſtrengthning his Intereſt, or raiſing his Fortune, but generally, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens quite otherwiſe, for that dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Familiarity between a Child and Servant which is founded in the contempt of Faith and Truth on the one ſide, and natural affection on the other, can never be firm and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, any little accident will undo all;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:96201:80"/>
Nature in the Child will return to it's bent, ſome little Obligation paſt upon him, or wholeſom advice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated in a fit ſeaſon will awaken his natural affection, and then he'l make no ſcurple to redeem his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour towards his Father or his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the diſcovery, that is, the Ruine of a perfidious Servant. But ſuppoſe this Combination or Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy ſhould hold ſome time, how can a Servant rationally expect a conſtant Friendſhip from him who upon very ſlight and trifling pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences could be divided from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his Brethren, and tempted to forget the Duty he owed the one, and the affection he owed the other.</p>
               <p>I have ſpoken of the main care of the Servant towards the Children of his Maſter, namely, his care to ſecure their good Morals; he that neglects this, or what is worſe, miniſters to the corrupting of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is guilty of the moſt fatal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs to his Maſter: for he who betraies the Virtue of the Son,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:96201:81"/>

conſtitute one Family with them, and therefore they have in their Place a Right to their proportion of all the advantages of the Family; they have in their degree a claim to the love and care of the Maſter, to the Brotherly Affection of the Children, and to the Reſpect and Duty of the Servants: I need not therefore repeat here all the Duties of the Servant, which are all of 'em in their time, place and degree, due to theſe whom the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath Adopted into his Family, and made members of that body, whereof he is the Head, ſo that 'tis impoſſible, that the Servant can wrong them, but that the injury muſt reflect and rebound on the Maſter. 'Tis true, there is great variety in the caſe and circumſtance of Sojourners, and by conſequence in the Duty of Servants towards them, ſo that 'tis hard to fix a conſtant and general Rule by which it may be meaſur'd and regulated; unleſs I ſhould ſay, that ſince whatever degree of Duty is owing 'em, ſprings from their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the Family, and Relation to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:96201:83"/>
the Maſter of it, therefore the Service and Reſpect towards them is to be proportion'd to the degrees of that Union which is between them, and the other Members of the Family, and the dearneſs and tie there is, or ought to be between them and the Maſter of it.</p>
               <p>This Rule I think will generally hold good, or at leaſtwiſe, a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſcretion will inform any Servant, what variation muſt be obſerv'd in this point: But here to compleat the Servants Inſtruction, I muſt put you in mind of two Rules more. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That you muſt avoid all occaſions of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between you and the Servants of Sojourners, contending rather in courteſie to eaſe and aſſiſt 'em, than putting off, what is your buſineſs and Duty, or any part of it upon them; and you muſt abhor to be any way inſtrumental to breed miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between Sojourners and your Maſter, for this is the unkindeſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice you can do both. <hi>Secondly,</hi> You muſt never go about to endear your ſelves to Sojourners by any Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:96201:83"/>
to your Maſter, that is, by entertaining 'em with the faults or ſecrets of the Family, or by prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Honour or Intereſt, or Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour before your Maſters: For in all this, you are ungrateful and unjuſt, and will finally forfeit that eſteem which you endeavour thus to raiſe: For how can thoſe which you careſs at this rate, believe that you'l be kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and truſtier to Strangers, than you have been to thoſe, to whom by the Law of God and Nature, you owe Obedience, Faithfulneſs and Love?</p>

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:96201:84"/>
Errand or buſineſs you charge your ſelves with, is unjuſt and diſcourte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo to obtrude your ſelves upon the affairs of Strangers, or to lie in wait for the ſecrets of your Maſter or his Friends, is inſolence and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, and as great a folly as rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and commonly unfaithfulneſs is join'd with this, and the Servant who takes pains to diſcover, doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally take as much to vent a ſecret, and all finally tends as much to their own diſgrace as their Maſters diſquiet.</p>
               <p>There is but one thing more that I would mind you of on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that is, your behaviour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a day of any Solemn Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Your Maſters and your own credit, as well as the ſatisfaction of his Gueſts are nearly concern'd in it, the decency of your attire, the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and chearfulneſs of your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, the order and ſilence of the whole management, being not only one of the faireſt Ornaments of the Entertainment, but alſo a good mark of your breeding, and of your Maſters prudence and good Government as

               <p>THE Duties which Servants owe one another, are the very ſame with thoſe which all Mankind are mutually oblig'd to, that is, <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> only their nearer Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to one another ties this Obligation faſter upon them, by adding new motives and incitements to theſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.<note place="margin">Of Mutual Juſtice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</note> Thus, <hi>Firſt</hi> for <hi>Juſtice,</hi> they are oblig'd to it towards one another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of Damnation, and by the hopes of Salvation, as all other men are. But then, they muſt further
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:96201:86"/>
conſider, that they are bound to it not only as Chriſtians, but as Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Servants, in which Relation, the more indiſpenſible neceſſity of Juſtice increaſes their Obligation to it, and renders the Tranſgreſſion of it more unpardonable. Fellow-Servants are ſo neceſſarily expoſed to the injuries of one another, and thoſe daily one's too, that their life would be intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, without a ſtrict obſervance of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> I need ſay nothing of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of pilfering and ſtealing, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one being watchful enough to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his own; but there are other ſorts of injuſtice, to which Servants are more prone, and againſt which they are leſs able to defend themſelves, ſuch are for inſtance, Lazineſs in one, Inſolence in another, and Lying in a third; the ſluggiſh Servant ſhifts the burden off himſelf, and this muſt lie ſomewhere; now this is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt injuſtice, for 'tis to eaſe one's own trouble by increaſing anothers. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond error to which Servants are prone, is <hi>Inſolence;</hi> there are no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſo tyrannical and domineering
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96201:87"/>
as is one Servant over another; and this is commonly the uſe a diſingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Servant makes of that Authority, which the favour or truſt of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter confers upon him, namely, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, inſult over, and deſpiſe his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Servants; methinks it ſhould now be difficult to convince any of you of the injuſtice of this behaviour; for how can any one of you be ſo ſtupid as to think that behaviour juſt in him towards his Fellow-Servants which he would think, were not to be endured in his Maſter towards him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? beſides, I cannot tell whether the folly of this carriage be not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the injuſtice, not only, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a Servant forgetting his own quality, upbraids himſelf, whilſt he inſults over his Fellow-Servants, and renders the worſt uſage his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Miſtreſs can treat him with, juſt and reaſonable, for he has no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain of his Superiors for that uſage, which he is guilty of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Equals; but beſides this, ſuch a Servant muſt expect to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermined at home, and moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:96201:87"/>
defamed abroad, and when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ill accident befalls him, or leſſens his intereſt in his Maſter, he muſt expect the juſt return of his inſolence in contempt and hatred. I would have ſuch Servants as theſe, call to mind what our Saviour ſaith of that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, who being by his Lord made Ruler of his Houſhold,<note n="*" place="margin">Matth. 24.49.50, 51.</note> 
                  <hi>Began to ſmite his Fellow-Servants, and to eat and drink with the drunken: The Lord of that Servant ſhall come in a day when he looks not for him, and in an hour that he is not ware of: And ſhall cut him aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and appoint him his Portion with the Hippocrites: There ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth.</hi> Now, tho' you ſhould not eat and drink with the drunken, yet if you ſmite your Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Servant, you ſhall have your ſhare of this puniſhment in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your guilt, or if you do not ſmite with the Hand, yet if you ſmite with the Tongue either by bitter and reviling Language, or by froward or malicious accuſations of your poor Fellow-Servants, to their Maſter or Miſtreſs, your guilt is much the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:96201:88"/>
ſame; he that doth the one, doth not want Pride or Uncharitableneſs enough to do the other, but is held in by ſome other motive than Juſtice or Charity. A <hi>Third</hi> ſort of Injuſtice incident to Servants, is belying one another, which whether it be by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellous diſcourſes abroad, or unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and baſe detraction in private at home, which is a common Artifice to make parties, and ſet one Servant againſt another: Or whether it be laſtly by ſly inſinuations or malicious accuſations to the Maſter, it matters little; this is in each inſtance the fruit of a naughty and wicked Heart, <note n="*" place="margin">Matt. 15.19.</note> 
                  <hi>For out of the Heart proceed</hi> not only <hi>Murders, Adulteries,</hi> &amp;c. but alſo <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Thoughts, falſe Witneſs, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; And theſe are the things which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file a Man.</hi> 'Tis ſtrange to obſerve, that if this ſin were to be eſtimated by the practice of Servants, 'tis ſo common, one would be tempted to think, it were no ſin at all: And yet if it were to be eſtimated from the word of God, one would be tempted to think it were the greateſt of ſins;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:96201:88"/>
for I do not know, whether there be any ſin againſt which more judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, more curſes, are denounced, or which is repreſented more deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God than Lying Lips, a Lying Tongue, a ſpiteful and a malicious Heart. There is indeed a ſort of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by way of Recrimination and Self-defence, which is generally thought to have ſomething of exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation in it, and ſomething indeed it has, but not enough to excuſe it, for the beſt that can be ſaid of it is this, it may ſometimes have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs of Malice and habitual Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, but it has never leſs of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and injuſtice, and therefore, is vile and diſhonourable in the ſight of Man, and damnable in the ſight of God. One ſort of Injuſtice more, I muſt juſt touch upon, and that is <hi>Envy;</hi> weak and baſe minds are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly ſubject to this, ſuch as are too ſluggiſh to have any Merit, and too ſelf-conceited to ſee their want of it; theſe, and theſe only are apt to be envious, and ſuch a one will count every excellence in his Fellow-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:96201:89"/>
a diſparagement to himſelf, and every favour vouchſafed another an injury to him: And this ſtirs him up to detract from anothers good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to ſupplant anothers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt by all imaginable Arts, which ſhews the hainouſneſs of this Crime conſiſting in the utmoſt contradiction to Juſtice and Charity, but this ſin is ſo great a Plague and Torment to ones ſelf, that methinks, there needs few motives to perſuade men not to entertain it, or to get rid of it. Thus much I thought neceſſary to ſpeak of this Duty of the Juſtice of Servants towards one another, and were this well obſerv'd, this would lay a ſure Foundation for <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for Mutual Aſſiſtance and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; for if you would not wrong one another either in word or deed, all occaſions of debate and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be cut off: It were very happy for you your ſelves, and for your Maſters and Miſtreſſes, if you could advance thus far, if you could come up to the pitch of honeſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, but this is not enough to

company and converſation of thoſe you cannot endure, nor will this only bereave you of the pleaſure you would take in one another, but of the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance you would afford each other, if you did love as Brethren: nor is this all, your diſcontents do generally rebound upon thoſe above you, and you grow by degrees as uneaſy and unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to your Maſters and Miſtreſſes, as you are to one another; nay any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet man tho' he could brook the trouble of your quarrels and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, yet to deliver himſelf from the diſparagement &amp; ſcandal of 'em, will judge himſelf obliged to diſcard all peeviſh &amp; contentious Servants, what over other good qualities they may have: And then another ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is, you loſe your good name, and lie under ſuch odious characters, that being caſt out of one houſe, no other will receive you; for who can be fond of noiſe and miſchief? This little, if it be ſeriouſly conſider'd, is ſufficient to convince you of your obligation to Charity, and Brotherly affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one another. I will now go on
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:96201:90"/>
to ſhew you in what inſtances you muſt expreſs this affection, having firſt only put you in mind that your Charity muſt be real, and not feig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that you muſt love not <hi>in word,</hi> but <hi>in deed</hi> and <hi>in truth;</hi> for Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie and Diſſimulation is as ſinful and miſchievous, and in common account at leaſt more odious and deſpicable, than profeſſed hatred or open conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Having premiſed this, I proceed; there are two waies by which you are to expreſs your mutual Charity, <hi>Firſt,</hi> by the mutual aſſiſtance you are to afford each other. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving conſtant peace and unity amongſt your ſelves. 1. If you be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with Charity towards one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, it will ſhew it ſelf in the good turns you will do one another, in the aſſiſtance you will yield to each other, and here ſure, the Soul of your fellow-Servant deſerves your aid in the firſt place, if he be ignorant &amp; unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Religion, and not only ſo, but incapable through the meanneſs of his education to inform himſelf in it by reading, for if he be not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:96201:91"/>
but what is worſe, viciouſly inclined, if he know God, but do not fear nor glorifie him as he ought, you cannot do God or him a more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervice than by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inſtruct and inform him, reading to him, and teaching him to read, or by endeavouring to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince his Conſcience of his Duty, and to make him ſenſible of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and happineſs of a Religious and holy life. Next to the ignorance of Religion, and Immorality, a Servant's ignorance in his buſineſs, requires your compaſſion and aid, and what help you afford him in this, is a work of excellent Charity in you, and ought to be acknowledg'd not only by your fellow-Servant, but your Maſter too, as an obligation; for 'tis a Real be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to both: To be brief, if you'l be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have your ſelves with that goodneſs, gentleneſs and ſweetneſs, that may evidence your love to one another, you muſt in a literal ſenſe <hi>bear one anothers burthens,</hi> you muſt pardon and forgive one another's infirmities, you muſt excuſe and conceal one anothers
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:96201:91"/>
Errours, unleſs they be ſuch, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply manifeſt unfaithfulneſs to your Maſter, in which caſe, they are no longer Errours and Frailties, but Crimes. <hi>Concord,</hi> which was the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond inſtance of Charity I recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to you, is the natural reſult of all this. For theſe mutual Aſſiſtances and Obligations can never miſs of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a right Underſtanding, and nouriſhing a ſincere Friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you; but yet becauſe <hi>Concord</hi> muſt be preſerv'd, where Friendſhip ſometimes cannot, and you muſt wiſh well to, and carry your ſelves fairly towards ſome Servants whom you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fancy, whom you cannot take any complacency or delight in: therefore I will ſay ſomething of this.</p>
               <p>I need ſay nothing more to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you of the neceſſity of <hi>Concord,</hi> than what has frequently been inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated all along this Treatiſe; only I will remind you how great the evils of Diſcord and Contention are; perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Vexation and Diſturbance to the Father of the Family, who muſt either with great prejudice to order and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:96201:92"/>
diſſemble his knowledge of your miſdemeanours, or to the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſening of his Authority become a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the quarrel, or elſe ſeem guilty of that ſeverity which is very uneaſy to every good Temper. The next evil that attends Diſcord, and that a very ſore one, is, it generally infects the Family with a peeviſh and fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſpoſition, and by degrees ſours the moſt ſweet and obliging humour. A <hi>Third</hi> evil is confuſion and diſorder in all buſineſs, for mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous and quarrelſom Servants are like factious men in a State, inſtead of aſſiſting, rather than not croſs one another, they will obſtruct the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and good of the Family. The <hi>Laſt</hi> evil of Diſcord is this, that it utterly indiſpoſes you for Religious Duties; and this is a ſad conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that by your brawls and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, you not only afflict and vex, but damn one another; theſe and many more being the miſchiefs of diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, 'tis plain, that you are to purchaſe Peace almoſt at any Rate; it will not then ſeem hard to you
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:96201:92"/>
that I ſhould preſcribe you two things for this end. Firſt, that you would not ſuffer your ſelves to be eaſily provok't, much leſs, be rude or irreconcileable upon any provocation; if you can maintain Peace with none but thoſe who are exempt from faults, you muſt converſe only with Angels, not Men: And if we are all liable to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and Offences, we muſt be all alike forward to bear and pardon 'em, which, methinks, ſhould be no very difficult matter to one who conſiders the Long-ſuffering and Patience of God towards him; I beſeech you to remember, what ſentence was paſt upon that wicked Servant who would not uſe that goodneſs towards his Fellow-Servant, which his Maſter had ſhew'd towards him.<note place="margin">Matth. 18.32, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>O thou wicked</hi> Servant, I forgave <hi>thee all that debt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou deſiredſt me, ſhou'dſt not thou alſo have had compaſſion on thy Fellow-Servant, even as I had pity on thee? And his Lord was wroth, and delivered him to the Tormentors till he ſhould pay all that was due unto him: So likewiſe</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ſhall my Heavenly Father
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96201:93"/>
do alſo unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his Brother their Treſpaſſes.</hi> This is a diſmal Iſſue of contentions, he is miſerable who doth wrong, how much leſs miſerable is he who doth not pardon it? the wrath of God will ſwallow up both. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that you may preſerve Peace, you muſt often do more than is your buſineſs to do, nor can this ſeem an unreaſonable advice to him that ſhall conſider, that the trouble of that work he doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his own, is not half ſo great as the trouble of quarrel and contention which he prevents by it: Nor can you poſſibly take a more ready way to rid your ſelves of a ſlothful and quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom Fellow-Servant; for the more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent you are to ſupply his Errours and Defects, the more confidently will he commit 'em, growing every day more negligent and intolerable, till his ſloth, and folly, and your Induſtry and Prudence can no longer be unknown to the Maſter. I have but one thing more to recommend to you in this place, and that is, that you ſhould be very tender of one anothers credit and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96201:93"/>
reputation, for this is the Livelihood and eſtate of a Servant, it is become faſhionable with men of all ranks, to make other's faults the ſubject of their diſcourſe and entertainment, and the meaner a mans Education is, the more ſubject is he to do this; but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monneſs of the ſin doth not leſſen it, much leſs excuſe it. It is the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of one of the worſt of men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.19, 20. <hi>Thou giveſt thy Mouth to evil, and thy Tongue frameth deceit. Thou ſitteſt and ſpeakeſt againſt thy Brother, thou ſlandereſt thine own Mother's Son.</hi> Nor is the folly leſs than the guilt of this ſin, for thou teacheſt others an evil Leſſon againſt thy own Soul, and doſt juſtifie the worſt practices thine Enemies can deviſe to defame and diſparage thee.</p>
               <p>I had deſign'd here to diſcourſe of the grounds and cauſes of ſtrife and contention, but this labour is preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by what I have ſaid upon the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Juſtice and Charity, where you may eaſily diſcern, what are the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſprings and cauſes of Diſcordn, ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Lazineſs, Lying, Envy, and ſuch like,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:96201:94"/>
and how great the miſchief and guilt of theſe is; but beſides theſe, there is a proud, froward, and churliſh Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which renders ſome Servants ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unfit for Converſation, makes 'em apt to do wrong, without any motive to it, and apt to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok't without any ground for it: this is a temper directly contrary to Charity, and therefore is by a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary conſequence ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd already under that Head: However, I cannot be too careful to ſecure you againſt this ſin, and therefore it will not be labour loſt to take particular notice of it here: Pride and Frowardneſs are the diſhonour of the greateſt Men; how intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then muſt they appear in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt? They are indeed vices, which one would think, the frailty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibleneſs of our nature would eaſily reſtrain us from, for proud and haughty wrath is unbecoming a poor ſinner, a corruptible mortal Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; what ſhould ſuch a one be proud of? or what can inſpire him with the arrogance of frowardneſs?
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:96201:94"/>
Now if there be in the nature of every man, let him be never ſo high, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument enough for Humility, ground enough to ſhame him out of Pride and Peeviſhneſs; what excuſe can there be for either in that man, where the meanneſs of his nature is rendred yet more contemptible by the meanneſs of his Fortune? But what do I talk of? theſe are mean, impotent and beggarly vices; theſe are weeds which grow no where but on dung-hills. A proud and peeviſh Temper is generally the ſymptom of a fooliſh underſtanding; a low birth, &amp; a lower Education: For the wiſer any man is, the better born, and the better bred, the more cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and the more humble he is, a conſideration which methinks, ſhould make you extreamly ſenſible of the diſhonour and ſcandal of this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: But after all, there is another Argument behind which ſhould even ſcare and frighten you into meekneſs and humility, and that is, that a proud and froward heart is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord; to be hated or deſpiſed by man, which is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96201:95"/>
fate of all ſuch tempers is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable ſtate, but to be hated by God, this is infinitely more dreadful and aſtoniſhing: As then you value, I will not ſay, your Service, but your Salvation, ſubdue this deviliſh Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: for aſſure your ſelves, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is unfit to live peaceably in any Family, can never enter into the company of Angels and Spirits of juſt Men made perfect: For all theſe are meek and gentle, kind and loving Spirits.</p>
               <p>Now for the Conqueſt of all theſe Vices which ingender ſtrife, you muſt obſerve the ſame method, which is wont to be preſcrib'd for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of any other, that is, you muſt lay before you frequently and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the guilt and miſchief of theſe ſins, you muſt endeavour to perſuade your ſelves of the lovelineſs and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the contrary Virtues, you muſt carefully avoid all occaſions of, and temptation to theſe ſins, you muſt watch over the motions of your own Hearts, you muſt reſolve ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon reformation and amendment,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96201:95"/>
you muſt call your ſelves to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for theſe your reſolutions, you muſt not faint nor be weary, tho' you do not preſently conquer; but you muſt repeat and reinforce all your vows and purpoſes, and go on pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently till you have brought forth Righteouſneſs unto Victory; and with all this, you muſt joyn fervent Prayers to Almighty God for his Aſſiſtance.</p>

               </head>
               <p>'Tis certain that every man's Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is his Intereſt, and that in whatever ſtation a man is, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can render him more proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in it, or more effectually recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to a better than a faithful and conſcientious diſcharge of the Duties of his place. Nor did <hi>Solomon,</hi> when he aſcribed to Wiſdom theſe glorious effects or fruits, <hi>length of days, Riches and Honour,</hi> underſtand by wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Subtlety, Craft or worldly Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, but purely a ſincere performance of our Duty towards God and Man: having therefore fully diſcours'd of a Servant's Duty both towards God and his Maſter, it might ſuffice here to tell him in general, that a ſincere
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:96201:97"/>
performance of this, is his only true wiſdom, his only true policy. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that this may more evidently appear, and that the Servant may be more ſenſible of the obligation he lies under to the Duties preſcrib'd him, I will deſcend to a particular conſideration of his <hi>Intereſt,</hi> a thing which Servants as well as others, are allow'd, nay obliged to perſue and advance by all fair means.</p>
               <p>It will eaſily be granted, that the Intereſt of a Servant conſiſts in theſe three things, his Credit, the Love of his Maſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the profit of his place; 'tis therefore a duty which concerns a Servant to conſider what courſe he muſt take to promote theſe three.<note place="margin">The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd.</note> 
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then, if we conſider the grounds of a Servant's Credit or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, it depends upon an opinion of his Religion or Virtue, and of his ability or ſufficiency for the place he undertakes; As to this latter, 'tis not my buſineſs to direct you in it, only I muſt put you in mind that there are ſome greneral qualifications, ſuch as Truth, Induſtry, and Humility,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:96201:97"/>
which are neceſſary recommendations to all ſorts of lawful Imployments; without which whatever skill or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience any man has, he is unfit for any ſervice. The other Baſis or Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of a Servant's Credit is, Religion and Virtue, he that has rais'd in others an opinion of his Virtue, hath by conſequence rendred himſelf more valuable and conſiderable to 'em, for ſuch is the Beauty and Majeſty of Virtue, that it commands from all ſome degree of affection and reſpect; and ſuch is the manifold uſe of it in the world, that he who is poſſeſſed of it, is preſently accounted of as more worthy and more ſerviceable than other men, which is a Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which commands eſteem. Now if you would poſſeſs men with the perſwaſion of your Virtue, the moſt effectual way is really to <hi>be,</hi> what you would fain appear to <hi>be;</hi> for a Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite cannot long be concealed, and when he is diſcovered, he looks more loathſom than an open ſinner: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that a Hypocrite lies under this one great diſadvantage, that his Diſſimulation once prov'd upon him,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:96201:98"/>
his Credit can never be redeem'd by his following ſincerity, his very Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſhall never find Credit with men, there being no way left man to diſtinguiſh it from a ſtrain of his known Art: You muſt therefore be really virtuous if you would gain a Reputation for Virtue; you muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be moſt eminent in theſe Virtues which are proper to your ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſobriety, induſtry faithfulneſs, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> for theſe are the Virtues men require and regard in you. There is ſcarce any place wherein there is not an opportunity of practiſing theſe in ſome degree, which practice is one way, and the beſt too of raiſing your Reputation; but beſides this, that you may both confirm and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe theſe Virtues in your ſelves, and the opinion that you have of 'em, in others, you muſt <hi>Firſt</hi> induſtriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly avoid all vicious company. For this, if it do not deſtroy your Virtue (which were next to a miracle) it will certainly deſtroy your credit; for no wiſe man will ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that you can be otherwiſe than vicious in vicious Company. This is
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:96201:98"/>
generally the ruine of moſt Servants; 'tis here they learn to deſpiſe Virtue, and their Maſters; 'tis here they learn to love Liberty and Idleneſs; and <hi>Finally,</hi> 'tis here they learn thoſe ſins which they can neither maintain nor enjoy without the guilt of diſobedience and unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to their Maſters, therefore follow the advice of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 4.14, 15. <hi>Enter not into the Path of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and go not in the way of evil men. Avoid it, paſs not by it, turn from it, and paſs away;</hi> where the wiſe man doth excellently inſinuate, that he that would be ſafe, can never keep too great a diſtance from evil company. <hi>Secondly,</hi> you muſt reſolutely arm your ſelf againſt, and carefully reſiſt the Temptations of the Family you are in; let not the Authority of great examples delude or deceive thee; let not any proſpect of Intereſt inſnare thee; let not the ſolicitations of thy fellow Servants perſwade thee; let no opportunity betray thee into ſin; for thou doſt purchaſe thy profit or the favour of man at too dear a rate, if by the loſs of thy Virtue, thy

                  <hi>Obſerve the Opportunity, and beware of evil, and be not aſhamed, when it concerns thy Soul; for there is a ſhame that bringeth ſin, and there is a ſhame which is glory and grace: Accept no perſon againſt thy Soul, and let not the Reverence of any man cauſe thee to fall.</hi> For thou mayeſt aſſure thy ſelf, that Virtue is never more honourable than when it ſtands the ſhock of Temptations, and deſpiſes the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Opportunity, and that whatever profit or honour ſin may flatter thee with, it will prove ſhame and bitterneſs in the latter end. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> beſides the practice of Religion in private, and the frequenting the Sacrament in publick, as often as you have Opportunity, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly attend to Family-Duties, for this peradventure is the only Rule by which your Maſter will meaſure your eſteem for Religion, and your eſteem for Religion is the only thing, or at leaſt the main thing, by which he will judg of your Truth and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs:
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:96201:99"/>
Not that this ſhould be your firſt and chief motive to it, for that muſt be not the opinion of others concerning you, but the Honour of God, and the improvement of your Soul; There lies upon you more than common Obligations to theſe Duties, for your abſenting your ſelves from 'em, is not only a ſlight put upon the Worſhip and Truths of God, but alſo an Act of Diſobedience to your Maſter. In the ſecond place, the meaner your Education is, the more ought you to covet theſe oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of inſtruction, and the leſs your time for Religion is (which you are often wont to pretend at leaſt) the more carefully ought you to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this time of Worſhipping God. Thus much of the <hi>Firſt</hi> thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the intereſt of a Servant doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, which is his Credit or Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The <hi>Second</hi> is the affection which his Maſter and others bear towards him, of which now.</p>
               <p>And here 'tis certain that the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Foundation of this affection or love, is the merit of your Service,<note place="margin">The Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Maſter, how at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd.</note> a Faithful, that is, honeſt and careful
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:96201:100"/>
diſcharge of your Duty; but beſides this, there are ſome qualities that do more immediately tend to recommend and endear a Servant, ſuch are <hi>Firſt,</hi> an humble and chearful temper, which always puts 'em forward even beyond the bounds of their indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Duty, makes 'em ready to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake even more than they are bound to, if they think it tends in the leaſt either to the intereſt or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of their Maſter, and in doing this, they muſt appear glad of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, deſirous of purchaſing their Maſters favour at any rate; and this is ſuch an obliging temper, that 'tis almoſt impoſſible to fancy a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſo ſtupid or ungrateful, as not to take notice of, Love and Reward ſuch a Servant. <hi>Secondly.</hi> He that will win the affection of thoſe he ſerves, muſt make it appear that he loves 'em, he muſt rejoyce in every good that befalls 'em, and be afflicted in every evil; he muſt be extreamly tender of creating 'em trouble or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance, not ſo much out of the fear of any damage growing from it,

as out of a filial delight in their ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and a filial affliction in their trouble; beſides all this, he muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſpeak well and kindly of 'em, he muſt look upon it as a lucky acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, when ever he has opportunity to check the ingratitude of a Fellow-Servant towards 'em, or to vindicate their Reputation againſt the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of a Stranger; and if he will take my advice, he muſt not only ſpeak well of his preſent, but his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Maſter: For I can hardly be perſuaded that a Servant will ſpeak well of me, when gone from me, who ſpeaks ill of him whom he ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before; but if there be nothing good which he can ſpeak of him, yet at leaſt, let him never ſpeak any ill of him, unleſs he be unavoidably for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to it. Nor let the Servant only ſpeak well of his former Maſter, but let him ſerve him to the utmoſt of his power, for gratitude to a former, is the Servants higheſt merit with his preſent Maſter. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant who deſires to be belov'd, keep at the greateſt diſtance he can from all
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:96201:101"/>
ſorts of quarrels and conteſts in the Family, let him never make any him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor be a party in thoſe made by others, and let him be ſo far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating himſelf into thoſe things which his Superiors or any others would keep ſecret, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he muſt rather fly from the knowledge of a ſecret, which others would diſcloſe to him, unleſs they have ſome good uſe to make of his truſt; all this that I have here directed, I would have performed, not with art and skill, but ſincerity; for a Servant cannot counterfeit an obliging temper long, if he do not endeavour to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs himſelf really of it: He muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to love his Maſter truly and heartily, or elſe it will be very hard for him to make a good ſhew of that love which he has not; and he muſt be finally endow'd with an humble and quiet ſpirit, or elſe it will be a very difficult task for him to ſtand neuter amidſt the quarrels of others, and to cloſe his Eyes and Ears againſt the ſecrets, news and tattle which moſt are ſo naturally inquiſitive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:96201:101"/>The third thing on which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of a Servant depends is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or gain of his Place:<note place="margin">The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, how ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced.</note> And here I need not tell you, that a Faithful diſcharge of your Duty ſerves moſt to promote this, for this, as you have ſeen, gains you affection at home, and credit abroad, and the Maſter will certainly give moſt countenance and encouragement as far as he is able to the Servant he loves beſt, and every Member of the Family will favour and aſſiſt ſuch a one as far as they can; and if there be no ground for a rational expectation of reward from thoſe he ſerves, his own credit, will in a little time open the way to it, an extraordinary Virtue can be no more conceal'd than the Light, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt private Imployment is Theatre enough to an excellent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but what is moſt conſiderable of all, he that ſerves faithfully in any Station, has God for his Spectator and Patron: There is therefore one thing only which I am to put you in mind of, and that is, that you be good Husbands of what you gain; I mean,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:96201:102"/>
that you do not waſt and laviſh it out in unneceſſary expences, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in fine Attire, or the extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of gaming or entertainments. And to this good Husbandry, you lie under the ſtrongeſt obligations that can be, for <hi>Firſt,</hi> By theſe ways, you bring into queſtion not your Diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only, but your Virtue too: For if a Servants expences look bigger than his gains, it cannot be thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable in the Maſter, if he do not only condemn his folly, but alſo enter into a ſuſpition of his unfaithfulneſs to him; or elſe his engagement in ſome unlawful courſe or other for the ſupply either of his Pride or Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality. But <hi>Secondly,</hi> The loſs of your credit is not the only evil, you are to apprehend from this Folly, but alſo Diſtreſs and Poverty one time or other: For Alas! The Revenue of a Gentleman is not able, (we ſee by dayly experience) to ſupport the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a ſpend-thrift, and how much leſs, the narrow ſalary of a Servant: 'tis true indeed, 'tis the extremity of unkindneſs in a Maſter to turn a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:96201:102"/>
faithful Servant to the Common, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he has ſpent his ſtrength and youth in his ſervice, but I think it is extremity of folly in a Servant to expect that his Maſter ſhould be kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to him than he is to himſelf, or to eat the bread of his old age at the Courteſie of others, when if he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he may eat his own. This can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but prove a very ſtrong engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Servants to thrift, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be conſider'd, that they are more unable to ſuſtain the wants and hardſhips of Poverty, than Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Day-Labourers are; for he ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally has not the ſame palate who is accuſtom'd to feed at his Maſter's Table, that the poor man has, who feeds at his own.</p>
               <p>But whilſt I recommend Thrift to you, and a regard to your own profit, I would not have you make uſe of this adviſe for a pretence to juſtifie either your want of Charity, or your quitting a ſervice wherein you have been highly obliged upon the leaſt ſhew of a little more gain in another: For firſt as to Charity, it is the Duty

of Servants as well as Maſters,<note place="margin">The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</note> God requires of every man in proportion to that wealth which he gives him, a part of it for the poor; and if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Servants Mite caſt into the ſtock of the Poor, ſhall be as great as that of the pounds of the Rich, no doubt the puniſhment of his unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs ſhall be as great as that of their's: For the refuſal of contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this his Mite, can't but be judg'd an extream wickedneſs, if it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that he may ſpare it eaſily, and that the reward of it is no leſs than a Heaven.<note place="margin">A Servant muſt not for a ſlight gain, quit the Service where he has been long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed and born with.</note> As to the ſecond thing, the quitting a ſervice wherein you have bin obliged upon ſhew of a very little gain, 'tis an action of extream folly and ingratitude, for a raw and untutou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Servant after he has bin formed and ſhaped, and fitted for ſervice, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to relinquiſh that Family where he has bin thus inſtructed in proſpect of a ſlight gain, is extream ingratitude; for certainly he ought to think his ſervice moſt due to thoſe who have made him a Servant, and taught him how to perform it: they
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:96201:103"/>
have done more for him, than they who after he is well qualified, give him larger wages: I do not know, whether I may not add, that this is Injuſtice in a Servant; for ſurely he that plants and watereth a tree, has beſt claim to it's fruit, and that Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter who has born the trouble of a Servants Ignorance, has the beſt right ſure to his better ſervice, which is but the fruit of his own Care, Patience and Inſtruction: Nay 'tis eaſie to be conceived, that this is due to him by a Tacit Pact and Contract; for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant cannot but think, that no Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would give himſelf the care and trouble which the inſtruction and Patience to be uſed towards a raw Servant requires, did he not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to reap ſome eaſe and fruit from it afterwards, to defraud him then of this rational expectation, doth look extreamly like Injuſtice as well as Ingratitude; Nor is the folly of this action generally leſs than the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, for Maſters generally love moſt, and confide moſt in thoſe whom they have themſelves bred up
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:96201:104"/>
and fitted, ſo that generally ſuch a Servant may thrive better by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than quitting his ſervice: But if this once grows to an humour of flitting and ſhifling from place to place, then the folly of it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able even to a Proverb, <hi>A Rouling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonce never gathers Moſs,</hi> for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever good Qualities ſuch a Servant may be poſſeſſed of, they cannot turn much to his profit, becauſe he does not allow time for the raiſing of his Credit, or the eſtabliſhing a value of, and affection for him in any Maſter; and theſe are the uſual ſeeds of a Servant's gain.</p>

Who knows not how often the love of the Maſter and Miſtreſs has been diſſolv'd, and their Honours blaſted by the lying

and deceitful Tongues of thoſe of their own houſhold? who knows not how miſerably the peace and quiet of Families has been diſturbed, the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and order of 'em deform'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and the Religion of 'em ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and their ſubſtance conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and exhauſted by the pride and peeviſhneſs, by the ſloth and careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the laviſhneſs and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of ill Servants. And can you think, that theſe, and innumerable other miſchiefs which your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of your Duty creates, the World ſhall go unpuniſh't?

As <hi>Firſt;</hi> As they enjoy not the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which Men of plentiful Fortunes do, ſo neither are they diſtracted by the cares which Maſters of Families may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be: Nor are they engag'd in ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions as the many deſigns and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of their Superiours do neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily expoſe them to; they live, if it be not their own fault, by conſtant Rules, they have all the advantages of retirement in the midſt of the World, lying under no preſſing Temptation either to care, or conteſt, or ſenſuality: So that unleſs they be extreamly careleſs of their Souls, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

they be extreamly inſenſible of the love of Jeſus, they muſt live in an habitual preparation for the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or at leaſt they can have no tolerable excuſe for the neglect of it.

The times are inverted, the Servant and the mean Man appears as much more ſtupid and negligent in the things of another Life, as he has leſs ſhare than others in this; they ſeem to be ſunk as much beneath the Virtue, as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of their Superiours, and being freed from the Cares and Emulations, from the Ambition and Deſigns of thoſe above 'em, their Souls ſeem to

compariſon of this, conferr'd upon you by your Maſter, or any body elſe, wherein you value as ſuppoſing him rich and great, would tranſport you into all the heats of thankfulneſs, and put you upon any task how hard or how mean ſoever, by which you might do him honour. I'le inſiſt no longer on this point, I'le only mention the little and mean objections againſt this Duty,<note place="margin">Objections Anſwer'd.</note> with which you are never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs wont to content your ſelves; you have, you'l ſay, ſo much buſineſs, ſo much work, that you have no time to prepare for the Communion. You do then ſerve not only a very hard, but a very fooliſh Maſter, ſo fooliſh, that I can ſcarce believe, there is any ſuch: for who can be ſuch a ſott as to be unwilling to give you time wherein you may give him the greateſt ſecurity, the ſureſt pledge of your Fidelity, Induſtry, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and all other Virtues of a good Servant, that his heart can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire? Can any man be ſuch a ſott as not to give a bad Servant time to reform in, or a good one time to
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:96201:113"/>
repeat his Vows and Reſolutions of his perſeverance, and to fortifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in his Duty by freſh engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? And this benefit certainly every Maſter reaps by his Servant's conſcientious frequenting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: and yet after all, let your Maſter be never ſo unreaſonable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, or ungrateful towards God, (for he is both in this) I muſt tell you to your comfort, no Servant is rendred unfit for the Communion by doing the Duty of his place, the diſcharge of your Duty towards man is a part of your Religion towards God; this peradventure may render your preparation leſs ſolemn and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, but never leſs acceptable; a ſincere ſigh or groan from you in ſuch a caſe as this, (if ſuch a one can be ſuppoſed) ſhall be admitted for as good ſatisfaction, as the moſt ſolemn confeſſion conſiſting in a particular enumeration of every ſin, and an act of ſorrow appropriated to each when perform'd by others who are Maſter's of their own time; a Devout Ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation ſhall be accepted from you as
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:96201:113"/>
well as the moſt careful trimming of their Lamps, the moſt ſtudious dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their Souls from others: But here let me beſeech you, that you do not abuſe that unto a plea for your negligence and ſecurity, which I have taught you only as a comfort under the neceſſity of your circumſtances: For when you have time for more ſolemn preparation, you muſt not out of preſumption or lazineſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent your ſelf with this, but this I muſt leave to your own conſciences, and to God the ſearcher of hearts to determine: this then, that you have no time, is a vain excuſe; but you'l ſay, you are ignorant and unlearned, and do not underſtand the nature of this Duty, why do you not then conſult thoſe that do? Is it ſo that there is no good Chriſtian in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily? Is there no Paſtor in the Pariſh? Is it poſſible that in theſe days of light, any, though the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the people, ſhould periſh for lack of knowledg. But you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to approach that table; and are you reſolv'd that you'l ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:96201:114"/>
ſo? If by unworthineſs, you mean any courſe of ſin; break it off ſpeedily, leſt you periſh in it, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure this call to the Sacrament may otherwiſe be the laſt Invitation to Repentance, the laſt tender of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that ſhall be ever made you: but if by unfitneſs, you mean Frailties and Imperfections, Defects and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, if this ſhould make us unfit, who then could be fit? If this ſhould make us unworthy, who then could be worthy? Sin and folly would be a qualification for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, if none were fit for it, but ſuch as were arrogant enough to think themſelves ſo, for that in this ſenſe of fitneſs, were to think themſelves void of defect and frailty, which were flatly repugnant not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Humility, but Truth too; But you'l laſtly ſay, you are conſcious to your ſelves of great weakneſs, and are afraid of entring into Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which you have much ground to fear you ſhall not be able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: If you prove unable, it will not be your ſin, but misfortune, but
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:96201:114"/>
I am afraid, you mean, which you ſhall not be always willing to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form: And if ſo, I muſt confeſs, I fear you are not fit for the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; for this inſinuates that your Heart at preſent is not ſincere, that your meaning is not right, and that you have ſome darling ſin, or at leaſt ſome remainder of ſin, which you cannot yet be fully perſwaded to part with: If it be otherwiſe, the weaker you are, the more need you have of that Sacrament by which you will be confirm'd and ſtrengthen'd; if you are ſincere, you are always ſafe.</p>

               <p>OUR Savour's Inſtitution of this Sacrament is thus related. Our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> the ſame Night that he was betray'd, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and gave it to his Diſciples, ſaying, Take, eat, this is my body which is given for you, do this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me. Likewiſe after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he took the Cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to 'em, ſaying, drink ye all of this, for this is my Blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for you, and for many, for the remiſſion of ſins. Do this,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96201:115"/>
as oft as ye ſhall drink it, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me. Out of theſe words, our Church forms that excellent Prayer, Almighty God our Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, who of thy tender mercy, didſt give thy only Son <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt to ſuffer death upon the Croſs for our Redemption, who made there (by his one oblation of himſelf once offer'd) a full, perfect and ſufficient Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Oblation and Satisfaction for the ſins of the whole World, and did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, and in his Holy Goſpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to continue a perpetual memory of that his precious death, until his coming again; hear us, O merciful Father, we moſt humbly beſeech thee, and grant that we receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe thy Creatures of Bread and Wine, according to thy Son our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt's Holy Inſtitution, in remembrance of his death and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, may be partakers of his moſt bleſſed Body and Blood: On the parts of this Prayer you may deſcant thus, O my God, and my Father, didſt thou give thine onely begotten Son to ſuffer death upon the Croſs
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96201:116"/>
for my Redemption! what then was my ſtate, that it was capable of no leſſer Redemption than the bitter death of thy Son? A ſtate of ſin and miſery; a ſtate of bondage and fear; a ſtate of darkneſs and affliction; a ſtate of wrath and death, death, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death; and ſhall I be ſo fond of this ſtate, as to continue in it, after thy Son has ſhed his blood to redeem me from it? Shall I deſpiſe this Redemption, and not haſten to be partaker of his Blood, and all the benefits of his death and paſſion? O my God, and my Father, it was an act of the moſt tender mercy in thee, to offer up thy Son to death for me. Ah what Ingratitude muſt I be guilty of towards thee, what cruelty towards my ſelf, if I neglect this great ſalvation, if I renounce, or at leaſt forget my Saviour, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my ſelf from any Intereſt in his death? O bleſſed Jeſus, didſt thou by thy one painful oblation of thy ſelf upon the Croſs, make a full, perfect &amp; ſufficient Sacrifice, Oblation and Satisfaction for the ſins of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:96201:116"/>
whole World? and can there be any thing more dear to me than the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of this thy love, more worthy of my remembrance than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the whole Word? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption! ah bleſſed word! What happineſs, what Heaven doth it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to be redeem'd by Chriſt, is to be tranſlated out of darkneſs into a marvelous light, out of the Regions and ſhadows of death, into the glory of the Sons of God, out of a ſtate of bondage, into the moſt perfect liberty, out of a ſtate of wrath, into a ſtate of Love and Mercy, out of a ſtate of Dread and Terrour, into a ſtate of Peace, and Joy, and Hope, or at leaſt, into a capacity of all this! and doth not all this deſerve, that I ſhould ever commemorate this thy Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of me and of the World, with devout joys, with humble tranſports, and the moſt grateful paſſion? Didſt thou need, O my Bleſſed Saviour, to inſtitute, and in thy Holy Goſpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand me to continue a perpetual memory of that thy precious death until thy coming again, leſt I ſhould
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96201:117"/>
forget it? Ah wretched nature! Ah wretched ſtate! Can there be any temptations that can betray me into ſo vile a baſeneſs? Can the love of the World, a falſe deceitful World, make me forget thee, thy Agonies, thy Wounds, thy Death, thy Love? Ah my dear Saviour! can it be ſo hard a matter to keep my remembrance and love of thee awake, alive, that thou ſhouldſt need to command me thus to commemorate thy death in the lively ſymbols and repreſentations of it, and to enforce thy command by putting me in mind of thy coming again? Methinks, without all this, my love for thee ſhould have been ſo bright and flaming, that I ſhould have deſpiſed all things as dung and droſs in compariſon of thee, and have deſired to have known nothing but Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified! methinks I ſhould have lived in the devout contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy great &amp; excellent actions, and thy great ſufferings, till I had been weary of this World, and of this body of this poor Beggarly and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſtate, and have long'd for my Diſſolution and Entrance into thy

preſence! this, thy love deſerv'd from me, even though I had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with the pleaſures, and crown'd with the honours of this World; how inexcuſable then muſt I be, who am one of the meaneſt of the people, who have no allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, no temptations in my For<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tune, if I forget thee and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake thee! Ah! how ſhall I ſtand before thee when thou comeſt again. How ſhall I behold thee in the glory of thy Father, and on this tribunal, if I ſhould now forget thy ſufferings for me, forget thy love of me, and neglect thy laſt, thy dying commands, the higheſt token of thy paſſion for me, ſhewing how ſolicitous thou waſt leſt I ſhould loſe the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of thy blood, when thou hadſt ſhed it! ah! with what, not ſhame and bluſhes, but horrour and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would my guilty Soul be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at thy appearance! but this ſhall never be my Crime, this ſhall never be my ſtate, never ſhall my Soul be guilty of ſuch ingratitude to the <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercys</hi> of my God, or the tender love of my Saviour: No; my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows

overflow me, my heart is wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within me, that I have forgot thee ſo long already, that I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred thee ſo ſeldom, that I have turn'd my back ſo often upon that Holy Sacrament, wherein thy paſſion ought to have been commemorated by me; O pardon, pardon, bleſſed Lord thy unkind, thy unfaithful Diſciple: I come to thee, I come to confeſs thee, I come to worſhip thee in the troubles and deſires of a broken Spirit, a contrite paſſion, a reſtor'd Faith, and a Revived affection. O receive me, cover'd with my tears, and with my ſhame, but raviſh't with thy love too; henceforth, O my Saviour, I will live with thee, nothing ſhall divide thee from me; not Buſineſs nor Intereſt, not Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions nor Friends, not the ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the body, nor diſtractions of the World, not life nor death it ſelf; I will live with thee in devout Prayers and Holy Meditations, and with an impatient paſſion, I will haſt to meet thee in the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which thou haſt appointed as

                  <p>FIrſt, <hi>The Exerciſe of Faith.</hi> The former Exhortation of our Church, to the Receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, lays down the deſign of Communion in theſe few, but full words; <hi>The moſt comfortable Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, is to be receiv'd in remembrance of his meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Croſs and Paſſion, whereby alone we obtain remiſſion of our ſins, and are made partakers of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> On which you may thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Lord, I believe, help thou mine unbelief, I believe that thou the Son of God, didſt take upon thee the form of a Servant, and waſt made in the likeneſs of Men, and being found in faſhion as a Man, didſt humble thy ſelf, and becameſt obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs. I believe, that by that thy painful Death, painful indeed to thee, but

comfortable and happy to us, thou didſt not only make an Oblation and Satisfaction for the ſins of the whole World, if they would believe and repent, but alſo purchaſe for 'em an Eternal Kingdom: I do therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire in this Holy Sacrament to make a publick Confeſſion of my Faith in thee, I am not aſham'd of the Goſpel of Chriſt, for 'tis the power of my God unto Salvation, I am not aſham'd of thee my Crucified Saviour, for I know, there is no other name given unto Man, by which he may be ſav'd, but only the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. I do therefore moſt earneſtly deſire to be made partaker of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of thy Death; and to have the aſſurance of my Redemption by thy Blood ſeal'd to me; for I have, O Lord, a weight of ſin that hangs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Soul, from which, unleſs thy Death deliver me, it will ſink me down into the loweſt Hell; therefore with impatience doth my Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to approach this comfortable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, where I may give thee the ſincere aſſurances of my Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance

and Love, and may receive from the aſſurances and pledges of my Redemption wrought by thy Croſs and Paſſion: But Lord, I know, that they only can draw near with comfort to this Sacrament, who with hearty Repentance, and true Faith turn to thee: I do therefore deſire to place my ſelf firſt as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God, and under the awe of his all-ſeeing Eye, to examine and try my Life and my Heart, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the moſt ſincere purpoſes of reforming what is amiſs in me; and help thou me, O my God, that I may do this as I ought to do, give me that juſt ſenſe of the weight and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this work, that I may do it with care and vigour, convince me ſo of the indiſpenſible neceſſity of ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that I may neither hide nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe any ſin in my <hi>Examination,</hi> nor make any, the leaſt reſerve for any in my <hi>Reſolution</hi> of amendment.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Here conſider firſt the courſe of your paſt Life in general.</hi> Thus, how you have behav'd your ſelves towards your Parents when under their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I mean not the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of your actions, which 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to recollect, but ſuch generals as theſe: Whether you have been notoriouſly diſobedient, whether you have notoriouſly neglected the means and opportunities of your Education, or by any other way procur'd the

grief, affliction or ſhame of your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: Then conſider your courſe of Life ſince you came into Service, as whether you have lived careleſly and coldly towards God in an habitual neglect, or it may be, contempt of Religion, whether you have been a Faithful and good Servant, or on the contrary, whether you have liv'd in the cuſtom and habit of Diſobedience or Unfaithfulneſs to your Maſter: And laſtly, as to your ſelves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether you have lived in a habit of Drunkenneſs, Gluttony, Uncleanneſs, Pride and Wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; now if upon Examination, you find your ſelves to have been guilty of any of theſe things in your paſt lives, it will be neceſſary to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs and bewail your error, altho' you have now long ago renounc'd it, broken off your ſin, and liv'd a new Life; and it will not be amiſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what aggravations are to be found in theſe your ſins; for example, what convictions you have reſiſted and ſtifled, what reſtraints you have broke through, what inconveniences
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:96201:121"/>
you have ſuffer'd by your ſins, what extraordinary Mercies and Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances you have had, what extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Chaſtiſements God has inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon you, what Opportunities of Grace you have ſlighted; theſe and ſuch like conſiderations ſerve to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Soul more Humble and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, and to quicken the ſenſe of Gods Goodneſs and Loving-Kindneſs towards you: When you have thus examin'd what the State of your Life paſt has been, you are ſecondly, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine what the preſent State of your Soul is, and here, you are to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether you are now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion and power of any ſin, and this your Conſcience, if it be not ſear'd, will ſoon inform you, for it cannot but tell you, that it has accus'd you for the Commiſſion of this or that ſin: But leſt you ſhould deceive your ſelves, you may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ſelves in the former man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner upon thoſe ſeveral Heads of your Duty treated of in this Book, as you ſtand related to God, to your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to your Maſter and Miſtreſs,

to their Children, to your Fellow-Servants, to your Neighbours in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and to your ſelves: Weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your preſent behaviour and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards each in this, as you did your paſt in the former part of this Examination.</p>
                  <p>If upon this view of your ſelves, it appears to you, that you live in any ſin, you muſt not only bewail it, and reſolve againſt it, but you muſt alſo make Reſtitution, if you have wrong'd your Maſter, your Fellow-Servant, or any other; if you have wrong'd 'em in their goods, you muſt reſtore it if you can; if you cannot, you muſt confeſs the wrong, and beg their pardon: If you have wrong'd 'em by Lying, you muſt diſcover the truth, and take the ſhame to your ſelves: If you have griev'd, diſturb'd and troubled 'em by rudeneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious Language, or any ſuch way, you muſt make 'em what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends you can, by confeſſing your error, promiſing Reformation, and begging Forgiveneſs: If you have been injurious to the Souls of any,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:96201:122"/>
you muſt be as induſtrious to reclaim 'em; when you have done all this, I would not have you make too much haſt to the Sacrament: But firſt, make ſome trial of the Truth and Sincerity of your Repentance; but in giving this Rule, I would be underſtood to ſpeak either of ſins of habitual Omiſſion, or elſe of thoſe notorious tranſgreſſions of Gods Laws, which the Scripture calls, the works of the Fleſh, the wickedneſs in which the Gentile World lay, the filthineſs of Fleſh and Spirit; for as to defects and frailties, tho' we muſt ſtrive againſt 'em, we ſhall never be free from 'em: As to Lukewarmneſs, Stupidity or Lifeleſneſs in Religion, if you mean by it a form of Godlineſs without the power, that is, that you profeſs to believe and live civilly, but the Duties that you perform are done heedleſly and perfunctorily, without any ſeriouſneſs, or any reliſh, and the whole application of your mind runs upon the World; this is a State to be repented of, and you muſt enter upon reſolutions of greater
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96201:123"/>
care and watchfulneſs, and fervency; and having done this, you may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Sacrament, without making ſo long a trial of your ſelves as in the former caſe; becauſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church nor your Neighbour can receive any ſcandal thereby.</p>
                  <p>Now beſide this part of Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſting in an enquiry what ſins you have been guilty of, or now live in: there is a ſecond part of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination conſiſting in this enquiry, what good you have done, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance there is between your life and the life of Jeſus, your Spirit and the Spirit of Jeſus? for negative righteouſneſs is not ſufficient to make a man a good Chriſtian, and though it be true, that we are not bound to the higheſt perfection under pain of damnation; yet the love of God, the love of Jeſus, and the hopes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal glory do all oblige us to aim at it, and therefore we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moan our non-proficiency, barreneſs and unprofitableneſs, I mean not, abſolutely ſuch, but comparatively with reſpect to what we ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:96201:123"/>
to: And that you may do this aright, demand of your ſelves, what requital have we made our Parents? What aſſiſtance have we afforded them ſince God has bleſſed us? What ſhare, of what God has proſper'd us with, have we given to the poor, the hungry, and the naked? What ſervice have we done for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſupport of any that have been any ways diſtreſſed? After this, read with a ſober devotion the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and examine the ſtate of your Souls by 'em; thus, am I poor in Spirit, contented in the loweſt ſtate, reſign'd up to God both as to my undderſtanding and my will, filled with humble thoughts of my own endowments both natural and moral? do I mourn under the ſenſe of my paſt ſins, and my preſent defects and infirmities? Do I weep in ſecrets for the ſins of my people, for the Deſolations and Diviſions of the Church of Chriſt, for the infidelity of Jew and Gentile, and in general, for the diſhonour God's name ſuffers in the World? Am I of a meek and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:96201:124"/>
quiet Spirit, peaceable, and ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, full, of humility and reverence towards all, but eſpecially my Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Maſters, ſtudying to do my own buſineſs, and to live quietly in my Station? Do I hunger and thirſt after righteouſnes? Is my Soul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with a deſire of ſaying know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? Do I delight in the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heavenly truths? Am I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh't with the Lovelineſs and Beauty of works truly great and truly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian? Am I merciful? do I delight to imitate my heavenly Father as far as I am able, being bountiful to the needy, compaſſionate to the diſtreſſed, long ſuffering towards the offender, gentle and eaſily intreated, carefully ſtudying and reſolv'dly purſuing the good of all, even of mine Enemies, and ſuch, whoſe either Ingratitude to me, or their averſion to their own good, renders the work much more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult? Am I pure in heart? Is the World crucified to me? Do I account all things but dung and droſs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of the excellence of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord? Do
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96201:124"/>
I love my God, and love my Jeſus, even to a thirſt after a diſſolution, that putting off the body, I may enjoy 'em in Heaven? Do I in the ſingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſimplicity of my heart pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the honour of God without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to any by-intereſt or corrupt affection? Am I a peace-maker, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to purchaſe it for my ſelf, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote it amongſt others by any tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail or pains, and by very great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to my ſelf? Do I purſue peace in the Church of Chriſt, in the State, in the Neighbour hood, in the Family, in my narrow, capacity withal imaginable zeal? Laſtly, Am I willing, if the will of God ſo be, to part with all, and follow Chriſt, to undergo not only reproach and contempt, but if need be, the ſpoil of all I have, nay Stripes, Impriſonment, and Death it ſelf? Theſe are the heights you are to labour after, and though you may fall very ſhort of 'em, this Examination will ſerve to encreaſe your humility, to make you more importunate for the aſſiſtance of God, and more deſirous of being
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96201:125"/>
ſtrengthen'd and refreſh't by the Holy Sacrament, nay it will excite and quicken your graces in you; for there is a lovelineſs in Virtue, and therefore the oftner you ſeriouſly behold it, the more you'l be enamour'd of it.</p>
                  <p>When you have diſcover'd by this Examination the ſtate of your Souls, then proceed to bewail 'em before God, thus; Theſe and many more which I cannot recollect, are my ſins, O thou Judge of the World, and theſe have all been repeated from time to time, ſo that they now are grown formidable to me for their very num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, &amp; yet beſides this, how provoking are the aggravations of them, that I ſhould ſin thus in defiance of the brighteſt revelation of thy will, in contempt of thy long ſuffering, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and goodneſs; in contempt of thy aſtoniſhing love manifeſted in my redemption by the blood of Jeſus, in defiance of thy great and precious promiſes, and of all the calls of thy Spirit and of thy Providence? nay, O my God, I have trampled under foot all my moſt ſolemn engagements, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96201:125"/>
returned to the commiſſion of ſin, in contempt even of my repentance, my vows and reſolutions, and canſt thou have mercy upon ſuch a wretch as I am? I know, I have moſt juſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok't thy wrath and indignation againſt me, my ſins are gone over my head as a thick cloud, they are a ſore burthen, too heavy for me to to bear, they are more in number than the hairs of my head, and my heart has fail'd me; but O Lord God, I do earneſtly repent, and am heartily ſorry for theſe my miſdoings, the remembrance of 'em is grievous to me, the burden of 'em is intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, I am aſhamed, yea even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded under the ſenſe of my folly and ingratitude, I have conſider'd thy terrour, and fearfulneſs and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling has taken hold upon me; I have conſider'd thy tender mercies, and my Soul is wounded within me, for having ſo falſly and unworthily forſaken and offended thee: I have conſider'd the humiliation and the ſufferings of my bleſſed Saviour, and my Soul ſuffers an Agony of love and

ſhame with in me for what I have done againſt my dear Lord. I have conſider'd the Beauty of Holineſs, and I loath my ſelf for the deformity and pollutions of my ſins: O therefore thou, who doſt delight to ſhew mercy to repenting Sinners, thou God of love and mercy, have mercy upon me, and O thou Lamb of God, which didſt ſhed thy blood for ſinners, have mercy upon me; thou that takeſt away the ſins of the World, have mercy upon me; and O my Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, deliver me not only from the guilt, but from the power of my ſin; I tremble indeed at thy wrath, and my ſoul faints within me, when I think of being excluded forever from tny preſence; but I do alſo loath and deteſt my ſin, O deliver me from it: aid me by thy bleſſed Spirit that I may conquer and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all my corrupt affections: O let that Spirit which was in Jeſus be in me alſo, that the life of Jeſus may be ſeen in all my actions, and the image of Jeſus may be form'd in my Soul, and my converſation may be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;

and here O Lord, I offer up and devote to thee even my Soul and my body, reſolving to live a life of Devotion, a life of Juſtice and Charity a life of Meekneſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility a life of Induſtry and Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, a life of Purity and Sobriety: O Lord ſtrengthen me, O Lord eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh me by the might of thy Spirit, by the power of thy Word, by the protection of thy Povidence, that I may perſevere and be faithful unto the end, and ſo obtain a Crown of Righteouſneſs, through Jeſus Chirſt our Lord.</p>
